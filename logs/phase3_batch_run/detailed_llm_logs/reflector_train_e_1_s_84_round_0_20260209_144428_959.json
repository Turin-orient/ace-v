Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"20.0\" in sentence: \"In February 2018 and June 2018 , the Company entered into amendments to the 2017 Loan Agreement ( the “ 2018 Amendments ” ) pursuant to which the Company , subject to certain conditions , was eligible to borrow a third term loan of $ 20.0 million during the period from April 2 , 2018 to December 31 , 2018 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"20.0\" in sentence: \"Pursuant to the 2018 Amendments , since the third term loan became available and the Company did not draw upon the third term loan , a fee of 1 % was applied to the difference between $ 20.0 million and the amount drawn , or $ 0.2 million .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"0.2\" in sentence: \"Pursuant to the 2018 Amendments , since the third term loan became available and the Company did not draw upon the third term loan , a fee of 1 % was applied to the difference between $ 20.0 million and the amount drawn , or $ 0.2 million .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"7.73\" in sentence: \"Term loans under the amended 2017 Loan Agreement bore interest at a floating rate equal to an index rate plus 7.73 % , where the index rate was the greater of 0.77 % or the 30 - day U.S. Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate ( “ LIBOR ” ) as reported in The Wall Street Journal , with the floating rate resetting monthly subject to a floor of 8.5 % .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: The $20.0 million is the principal amount available to be borrowed as a distinct term loan (the maximum/face amount of that debt instrument). Map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (principal/face amount of a term loan). Q2: In this sentence the $20.0 million is used as the referenced maximum amount against which a fee is calculated (i.e., the available principal cap); map to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity as the contractual cap/reference amount. Q3: The $0.2 million is the monetary fee charged for not drawing the loan; it is an instrument-related financing cost/fee tied to the term loan—map to InterestExpenseDebt (instrument-specific financing/interest-like expense). Q4: “index rate plus 7.73%” is a spread/margin over LIBOR/index; per the LIBOR-plus pattern map 7.73% to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00008\", \"ctx-00009\", \"ctx-00012\", \"ctx-00003\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,InterestExpenseDebt,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,InterestExpenseDebt,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentCarryingAmount,DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount,LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined each question and compared the model's tag choices to the ground truth and the actual sentence context.\\n\\nQ1 (entity \\\"20.0\\\"; sentence: eligible to borrow a third term loan of $20.0 million): I mapped this to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount because I treated \\\"$20.0 million\\\" as the contractual principal/face amount available for borrowing. The ground truth is DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. The sentence is describing a term-loan amount in the context of a loan amendment; in many disclosure labelling schemes the amount of a debt instrument mentioned in this context maps to the carrying/book value rather than a generic 'face' label.\\n\\nQ2 (entity \\\"20.0\\\" used as reference for a fee): I labeled it LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity, reasoning it was the cap used to compute the fee. The ground truth again is DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount (same tag as Q1). I should have used the same debt-instrument tag as Q1 because the $20.0 is the same contractual loan amount being discussed as part of the debt instrument disclosure, not a separate facility capacity concept.\\n\\nQ3 (entity \\\"0.2\\\"; sentence: \\\"a fee of 1% was applied to the difference between $20.0 million and the amount drawn, or $0.2 million\\\"): I labeled $0.2 million as InterestExpenseDebt because I interpreted it as the fee amount. That was incorrect. The sentence states a 1% fee applies to the difference (the remaining undrawn amount), and the appositive \\\"or $0.2 million\\\" clarifies that the difference equals $0.2 million. So $0.2 million is the undrawn remainder (remaining borrowing capacity), not the fee itself. The ground truth tag is LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity, which correctly captures this meaning.\\n\\nQ4 (entity \\\"7.73\\\"; sentence: \\\"\"index rate plus 7.73%\\\"\"): I mapped 7.73% to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. That matches the ground truth and is correct: it is the contractual spread/margin over the index.\\n\\nSummary of mistakes: wrong distinction between face vs carrying amount for debt instrument amounts (Q1,Q2) and mis-parsing the appositive that identifies $0.2 as the undrawn difference rather than the fee (Q3). Q4 was correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"1) Mistagged the loan amount ($20.0) as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount and as LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity instead of DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. 2) Misinterpreted $0.2 as a fee amount (InterestExpenseDebt) rather than the undrawn difference / remaining borrowing capacity (LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity).\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Two root problems: (a) conceptual confusion between 'face amount' and 'carrying amount' in debt disclosures — I applied a generic 'face/principal' heuristic rather than checking how the dataset labels loan mentions in amendment/availability contexts (which here map to carrying amount). (b) Syntactic/pronominal parsing error: failing to resolve the appositive \\\"or $0.2 million\\\" to its correct antecedent (the difference between $20.0 million and the amount drawn). That led to mislabeling the quantity as a fee rather than as the undrawn remainder. I also over-relied on a shallow heuristic that monetary amounts tied to a fee word must be an expense tag.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1) For amounts that describe a specific debt instrument in an amendment or borrowing context, prefer DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount when the ground-truth taxonomy maps instrument mentions to carrying/book values — use the same tag consistently for the same instrument mention across related sentences. 2) Parse the exact grammatical structure: identify the head noun that the numeric phrase modifies. In Q3, recognize the structure \\\"a fee of 1% was applied to the difference between $20.0 million and the amount drawn, or $0.2 million\\\" — the appositive \\\"or $0.2 million\\\" modifies \\\"the difference\\\", so tag $0.2 as remaining borrowing capacity. 3) Only tag a numeric amount as an expense (InterestExpenseDebt) when the text explicitly states the numeric value is the fee or interest charged (e.g., \\\"a fee of $X was charged\\\"). If the number is the basis for a fee calculation (the base amount), tag it as capacity/remaining principal. 4) Keep the Q4 logic: spreads expressed as \\\"plus X%\\\" should map to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish the semantic role of each numeric mention by (a) finding the noun it modifies (principal, fee, difference, capacity, spread), and (b) using consistent taxonomy mapping for debt mentions (face vs carrying). When an amount is described as the base or residual used to compute a fee, tag it as remaining borrowing capacity; when an amount names the debt instrument's amount on the balance sheet in a loan disclosure, prefer the carrying-amount tag. Always resolve appositives (\\\"or $...\\\") to their antecedent before tagging.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
