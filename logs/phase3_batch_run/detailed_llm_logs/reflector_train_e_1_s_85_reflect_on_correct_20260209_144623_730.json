Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"Effective December 31 , 2017 , we amended the 2016 Single Premium QSR Agreement to increase the amount of ceded risk on performing loans under the agreement from 35 % to 65 % for the 2015 through 2017 vintages .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"65\" in sentence: \"Effective December 31 , 2017 , we amended the 2016 Single Premium QSR Agreement to increase the amount of ceded risk on performing loans under the agreement from 35 % to 65 % for the 2015 through 2017 vintages .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"65\" in sentence: \"Under the 2018 Single Premium QSR Agreement , we expect to cede 65 % of our Single Premium NIW beginning with the business written in January 2018 , subject to certain conditions that may affect the amount ceded , including a limitation on ceded premium written equal to $ 335 million for policies issued between January 1 , 2018 and December 31 , 2019 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.1\" in sentence: \"Depreciation expense was $ 2.1 million and $ 1.9 million for the three - month periods ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively , and $ 5.9 million and $ 4.9 million for the nine - month periods ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . 9 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric mention to the most appropriate US GAAP tag by matching the semantic role of the numeric in its sentence to the available tags.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined each numeric mention and matched its semantic role to the candidate US GAAP tags. For Q1–Q3 the values are percentages describing the portion of risk ceded (35% and 65%), so the appropriate tag is a percentage-type tag; among the list, ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 is the generic percent tag that best fits a percent-of-exposure context. For Q4 the $2.1 million figure is explicitly labeled as depreciation expense for the period, so the Depreciation tag is the direct lexical match. The model used unit cues (percent vs currency) and lexical matching (’ceded’, ’%’, ’depreciation expense’) to select tags, yielding ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 for the percentage mentions and Depreciation for the expense amount.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error: the predicted tags match the ground truth exactly.
