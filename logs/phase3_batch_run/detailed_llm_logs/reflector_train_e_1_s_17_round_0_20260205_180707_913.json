Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"487\" in sentence: \"The fair value of our Senior Notes due 2026 ( as defined below ) was $ 487 million as of December 31 , 2016 .

The fair value of our Senior Notes due 2046 ( as defined below ) was $ 397 million as of December 31 , 2016 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"3.550\" in sentence: \"( b ) The debt issuance costs and unamortized discount is recognized as a reduction in the carrying value of the Senior Notes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is being amortized to interest expense in our Consolidated Income Statements over the expected remaining terms of the Senior Notes .

Playbook instrument-anchor heuristics (instrument-type detection + lexical mappings) indicate that numeric amounts tied to named debt instruments should map to debt-instrument-specific tags. Step 2 — 487 and 397: each sentence: “The fair value of our Senior Notes ... was $ 487 million” and “… was $ 397 million …” contains the cue “fair value” + instrument anchor -> map to DebtInstrumentFairValue (instrument-specific fair value tag overrides generic long-term debt tags). Step 3 — 3.550: phrase “we issued 3.550 % Senior Notes” = issuance language with a percentage immediately adjacent to the instrument anchor -> map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (stated coupon/interest rate on issued debt). Step 4 — 600: phrase “$ 600 million aggregate principal amount” tied to Senior Notes issuance is the face/aggregate principal amount of the debt instrument -> map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. Final mapping (in order of questions): DebtInstrumentFairValue, DebtInstrumentFairValue, DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00005\", \"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00005\", \"ctx-00006\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLongTermDebtFairValue,LongTermDebtFairValue,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined the model's trace and compared predicted tags to the ground truth. The sentences both describe the fair value of “Senior Notes” at year-end: “The fair value of our Senior Notes due 2026 ... was $487 million ...” and “... Senior Notes due 2046 ... was $397 million ...”. The model correctly recognized the lexical cue “fair value” and the instrument anchor “Senior Notes”, so it mapped both numeric values to a fair-value tag. For the interest rate and principal amount sentence, the model correctly identified the stated coupon (3.550%) and the aggregate principal ($600 million) and mapped them to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage and DebtInstrumentFaceAmount respectively. The mismatch occurs only for the fair-value tags: model selected DebtInstrumentFairValue, but the ground truth uses LongTermDebtFairValue. The core difference is taxonomy specificity: senior notes are long-term debt instruments and a more specific long-term-debt fair-value tag exists in the provided tag set; that should be preferred over the generic debt-instrument fair-value tag.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model used the generic DebtInstrumentFairValue for the fair values of senior notes instead of the more specific LongTermDebtFairValue tag present in the tag set. In other words, it failed to prefer a more specific, instrument-class-aligned tag when one was available.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model applied a generic rule: numeric amount + instrument anchor + 'fair value' -> DebtInstrumentFairValue. It did not check for a more specific tag that matched the instrument class (long-term debt). This indicates a gap in the tag-selection heuristic: when both a generic and a more specific tag exist, the model's priority rules do not prefer the more specific, semantically accurate taxonomy entry (LongTermDebtFairValue) for instruments clearly identified as long-term debt (Senior Notes, maturities in 2026 and 2046).\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When mapping fair value amounts tied to named debt instruments, first determine the instrument class from the text (e.g., 'Senior Notes', 'notes due YYYY', explicit maturities beyond one year => long-term debt). Then search the available tag set for the most specific applicable tag. If a LongTermDebtFairValue tag exists and the instrument is long-term, choose it instead of a generic DebtInstrumentFairValue. Concretely: (1) detect anchor tokens ('Senior Note(s)', 'Notes due', maturity year), (2) determine term (maturity > 12 months -> long-term), (3) lookup tags and prefer class-specific tag (LongTermDebtFairValue) over generic tags. Apply the same selection logic for all fair-value mappings.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When multiple candidate tags exist, prefer the one most specific to the instrument class identified in the text (e.g., long-term debt vs generic debt instrument). Use lexical cues (instrument name, maturity date, 'senior notes') to determine the class before selecting the tag.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
