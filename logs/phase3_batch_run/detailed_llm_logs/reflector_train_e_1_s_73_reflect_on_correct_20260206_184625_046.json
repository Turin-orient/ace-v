Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"4.8\" in sentence: \"As of June 30 , 2018 , the cost basis and accumulated amortization related to lease intangibles are as follows ( in thousands ) : As of December 31 , 2017 , the cost basis and accumulated amortization related to lease intangibles were as follows ( in thousands ) : Amortization expense of in - place leases was $ 3.8 million and $ 4.8 million for the three months ended June 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.8\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense of in - place leases was $ 7.8 million and $ 9.5 million for the six months ended June 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"9.5\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense of in - place leases was $ 7.8 million and $ 9.5 million for the six months ended June 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.72\" in sentence: \"DEBT FINANCING As of June 30 , 2018 and December 31 , 2017 , the Company had approximately $ 364.1 million and $ 379.3 million of debt outstanding , with a weighted average year to maturity of 3.4 years and 3.8 years , and a weighted average interest rate of 2.72 % and 2.63 % , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1–3) The three amounts (4.8, 7.8, 9.5 million) are described as “Amortization expense of in-place leases ... for the [period]” and arise from lease intangibles. This is an amortization expense line (not a lease payment, not depreciation, not impairment), so map to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 4) The 2.72 value is given as a “weighted average interest rate … a weighted average interest rate of 2.72% and 2.63%,” i.e., a portfolio-level weighted average interest rate on the company’s outstanding debt. That is best captured by DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate (preferred over a per-instrument stated-rate tag because the phrase explicitly reports a weighted-average rate across debt). Applied playbook heuristics: detect \\\"amortization expense\\\" → amortization-of-intangibles mapping; detect \\\"weighted average interest rate\\\" and debt/outstanding context → weighted-average-interest-rate tag (use interest-rate guidance for percent interpretation).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"ctx-00008\",\n    \"ctx-00004\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each sentence for the noun phrases and the qualifier words that determine the correct US GAAP tag. For items 1–3 the sentences state \\\"Amortization expense of in-place leases ... was $X million ... for the [period].\\\" The phrase \\\"Amortization expense\\\" together with the explicit reference to \\\"lease intangibles\\\" indicates these are amortization amounts of intangible assets, so the correct tag is AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. For item 4 the sentence reports a percentage as a \\\"weighted average interest rate\\\" on the company's outstanding debt (\\\"a weighted average interest rate of 2.72% and 2.63%\\\"), so the appropriate tag is DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate. I also considered other candidate tags (e.g., general InterestRate tags or OperatingLeaseExpense) and ruled them out because the text explicitly uses \\\"amortization\\\" and \\\"weighted average interest rate,\\\" which map unambiguously to the chosen tags.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error: the model's mapping and final answers match the ground truth exactly. There is no mismatch between predicted tags and the ground-truth tags provided.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because the prediction was correct. However, common close-call confusions that could have caused an error in similar tasks include (a) misreading \\\"amortization\\\" as \\\"depreciation\\\" or general lease expense, and (b) choosing a per-instrument interest-rate tag instead of the portfolio-level \\\"weighted average\\\" tag. Neither occurred here because the wording in the source explicitly disambiguated both cases.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue the approach used: (1) locate trigger words (e.g., \\\"amortization expense\\\", \\\"weighted average interest rate\\\"); (2) read the modifying noun phrase that limits the scope (e.g., \\\"lease intangibles\\\", \\\"of debt outstanding\\\"); (3) select the taxonomy tag that most precisely matches both the metric type (amortization vs. expense vs. rate) and the scope (intangible asset amortization vs. weighted-average debt interest rate). If ambiguity remains, check surrounding sentences for clarifying context (asset type, instrument-level vs. portfolio-level).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map explicit metric verbs/nouns (\\\"amortization\\\", \\\"expense\\\", \\\"weighted average interest rate\\\") to tags that match both the metric type and scope. Prefer a tag that mirrors the exact phrasing (e.g., AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets for amortization of intangibles; DebtWeightedAverageInterestRate for a portfolio weighted-average rate).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
