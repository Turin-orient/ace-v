Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"5.1\" in sentence: \"The following table reflects these intangible assets by major category : Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 7.7 million , $ 5.1 million and $ 7.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.9\" in sentence: \"The following table reflects these intangible assets by major category : Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 7.7 million , $ 5.1 million and $ 7.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"400\" in sentence: \"Debt and Credit Agreements In November 2016 , the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility ( the “ Senior Secured Credit Facility ” ) , consisting of a $ 400 million revolving credit facility ( the \" Revolving Credit Facility \" ) and a $ 550 million term loan facility ( the \" Term Loan Facility \" ) .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"550\" in sentence: \"Debt and Credit Agreements In November 2016 , the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility ( the “ Senior Secured Credit Facility ” ) , consisting of a $ 400 million revolving credit facility ( the \" Revolving Credit Facility \" ) and a $ 550 million term loan facility ( the \" Term Loan Facility \" ) .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Entities $5.1M and $7.9M appear in the phrase \\\"Amortization expense for intangible assets was $7.7 million, $5.1 million and $7.9 million...\\\". Per the amortization mapping (ctx-00004) any currency numeric token in the same sentence with an Amortization cue and an intangible qualifier should be mapped to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. Therefore both 5.1 and 7.9 map to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets.\\n\\n2) The $400 million figure is described as \\\"a $400 million revolving credit facility.\\\" Per the credit-facility vs capacity rules (ctx-00009) a currency amount that states the size of a revolving credit facility is the facility maximum/commitment amount and should be mapped to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. Unit-and-anchor validation (ctx-00010) confirms currency + facility-anchor match is valid.\\n\\n3) The $550 million figure is described as \\\"a $550 million term loan facility.\\\" This is the principal/face amount of a named debt instrument (term loan). Using unit-and-anchor validation (ctx-00010) and instrument mapping principles, the best-matching tag for the principal amount of a debt instrument is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\\n\\nApplied playbook heuristics: matched Amortization cue + intangible qualifier (ctx-00004); facility-capacity/revolver mapping (ctx-00009); unit-and-anchor validation for currency+instrument anchors (ctx-00010).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00004\",\n    \"ctx-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00010\",\n    \"ctx-00005\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the ground truth. For items 1 and 2 the model correctly mapped the amounts ($5.1M and $7.9M) to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets because they appear in the sentence with the explicit amortization cue and an \\\"intangible\\\" qualifier. For item 4 the model correctly mapped the $550M term loan principal to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount because the phrase names a term loan facility and gives its principal size. The single mismatch is item 3: the model labeled the $400M revolving credit facility as LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity, but the ground truth is LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity. The model applied a rule that equates a facility \\\"size\\\" with a facility's maximum/commitment amount; however in the annotation scheme used for the ground truth the plain statement \\\"a $400 million revolving credit facility\\\" should be tagged as the facility's current borrowing capacity. In short: the semantic distinction between \\\"maximum/commitment capacity\\\" and \\\"current borrowing capacity\\\" was misapplied. The rest of the mappings were correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the $400M revolving credit facility as LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity instead of the correct LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a conceptual confusion about which tag corresponds to a facility's stated dollar amount in descriptive sentences. The model treated any stated facility size as the facility's maximum/commitment amount without consulting the specific tag definitions or the annotation convention used here. It did not distinguish between phrases that explicitly indicate 'maximum', 'commitment', or 'unused capacity' and plain descriptions that the ground truth treats as the current borrowing capacity.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When a sentence states \\\"a $X million revolving credit facility\\\" (or similar descriptive phrasing) prefer the LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity tag unless the text explicitly uses words like 'maximum', 'maximum borrowing capacity', 'commitment', 'commitment amount', or 'maximum availability'. Use LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity only when the text explicitly indicates the maximum or committed capacity (or when nearby context clarifies it's the facility limit). Also consult playbook/tag definitions for the precise distinction between 'current borrowing capacity' and 'maximum borrowing capacity' before mapping.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish 'facility size' descriptions from 'maximum/commitment' statements: default to LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity for plain facility size phrases unless explicit maximum/commitment language appears. Always check the tag definitions/annotation conventions when two similar tags (current vs maximum) are possible.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00004\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"neutral\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00005\", \"tag\": \"neutral\"}\n  ]\n}",
