Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"13,488\" in sentence: \"The Company ’ s stock - based awards to non - employee directors have not been material . Accounting for share - based compensation Total compensation cost for share - based payment arrangements was $ 10,730 , $ 13,488 and $ 19,289 , for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"19,289\" in sentence: \"The Company ’ s stock - based awards to non - employee directors have not been material . Accounting for share - based compensation Total compensation cost for share - based payment arrangements was $ 10,730 , $ 13,488 and $ 19,289 , for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"2,678\" in sentence: \"The related tax benefit recognized in net income was $ 2,678 , $ 5,058 , and $ 7,040 , for the same years , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"5,058\" in sentence: \"The related tax benefit recognized in net income was $ 2,678 , $ 5,058 , and $ 7,040 , for the same years , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) The sentence \\\"Total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements was $10,730, $13,488 and $19,289, for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\\\" is reporting total share-based compensation expense amounts by year. Per the playbook equity/plan mapping and general lexical-to-tag mapping for share-based payment expense, the most appropriate tag is the generic ShareBasedCompensation (captures total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements). Thus 13,488 -> ShareBasedCompensation. 2) Same rationale for 19,289 (2016) -> ShareBasedCompensation. 3) The sentence \\\"The related tax benefit recognized in net income was $2,678, $5,058, and $7,040, for the same years, respectively.\\\" refers to the tax benefit related to the share-based compensation. The taxonomy contains a specific tag EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense which precisely matches \\\"related tax benefit recognized\\\" from share-based compensation; therefore map 2,678 and 5,058 to EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense. I avoided mapping these tax-benefit amounts to generic tax tags or to unrelated compensation tags by using the specific share-based-compensation tax-benefit tag shown in the taxonomy.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensation,ShareBasedCompensation,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensation,ShareBasedCompensation,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense,AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the ground truth. The model correctly recognized that the amounts $13,488 and $19,289 are share‑based compensation expense amounts and that $2,678 and $5,058 are tax benefits related to share‑based compensation. It therefore mapped the tax benefit amounts to the specific taxonomy tag EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense (which matches the ground truth). For the two expense amounts the model selected the generic ShareBasedCompensation tag. The ground truth, however, uses the more specific AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense tag for those same amounts. The model failed to prefer the more specific \\\"allocated expense\\\" tag even though the sentence context — \\\"Total compensation cost for share‑based payment arrangements was $10,730, $13,488 and $19,289\\\" — corresponds to an expense amount reported on the income statement and matches the AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense concept in the taxonomy.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model chose a generic ShareBasedCompensation tag instead of the more specific AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense tag for the two expense amounts ($13,488 and $19,289). Everything else (the tax benefit mappings) was correct.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a granularity/label‑selection error: the model matched the surface lexical concept \\\"share‑based compensation\\\" but did not check for a more precise taxonomy term that better matches the phrasing \\\"Total compensation cost...\\\" and the reporting context (expense recognized in the income statement). In other words, the model applied a broad lexical mapping instead of preferring the taxonomy tag whose preferred label and definition specifically describe an allocated compensation expense.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When multiple candidate tags could apply, inspect the taxonomy labels and definitions and prefer the more specific tag that matches both the lexical phrasing and the reporting context. For the sentence \\\"Total compensation cost for share‑based payment arrangements was $10,730, $13,488 and $19,289...\\\" the correct tag is AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense because it explicitly represents the allocated compensation expense reported in the income statement. Continue to use EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationTaxBenefitFromCompensationExpense for the related tax benefit amounts, as the model did.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When mapping numeric amounts to taxonomy tags, prefer the most specific taxonomy element whose preferred label and definition align with the phrasing and context (e.g., \\\"total compensation cost\\\" -> AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense). Use lexical match plus taxonomy definition checks rather than the first plausible lexical match.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
