Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model saw two amounts described as “revenues … for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 … from Pet Partners.” It applied a specificity rule and mapped them to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax because there is a customer anchor (“from Pet Partners”) and the phrase contains the word “revenues.” For the two goodwill amounts the model correctly mapped to Goodwill because they are explicitly described as the carrying amount of goodwill at specific dates (balance-sheet amounts). The ground truth, however, uses the more general Revenues tag for the first two amounts rather than the contract-specific revenue tag the model chose.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model over-applied a specificity rule and selected a contract-specific revenue tag (RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax) instead of the general Revenues tag. In other words, it preferred a more specific concept when the dataset/annotation expects the broad line-item label.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The mistake stems from a misapplied annotation strategy: treating any mention of a customer/source (\\\"from Pet Partners\\\") as a signal to use the contract-specific revenue taxonomy term. The underlying concept misunderstood is that sentence-level context (a condensed consolidated statement of income, top-line amounts) often maps to generic income statement labels (Revenues) despite naming a customer. The model did not consider the labeling conventions of the annotation target (which prefer the generic Revenues tag for top-line statement amounts).\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Prefer the generic income-statement tag Revenues for amounts presented as the company’s revenue line items in a condensed consolidated statement of income, unless the sentence explicitly discusses contract accounting detail that requires the contract-specific element. Concretely: (1) Recognize the context — 'Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income includes revenues of $X and $Y' signals the parent revenue line; choose Revenues. (2) Reserve RevenueFromContractWithCustomer... for sentences that discuss contract revenue recognition specifics (e.g., performance obligations, contract balances, revenue recognized from a specific contract type) rather than simple reporting of line-item amounts. (3) Keep the more specific tag only when annotation guidelines or surrounding text clearly require it.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When mapping amounts that are presented as headline income statement line items (e.g., 'includes revenues of $X'), use the general Revenues tag. Avoid switching to contract-specific revenue tags solely because a customer or source is named; only use the contract-specific tag when the text discusses contract-level accounting detail.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
