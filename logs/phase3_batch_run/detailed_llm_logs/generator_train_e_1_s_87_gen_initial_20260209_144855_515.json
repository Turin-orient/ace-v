Anti-pattern: tagging both an 'aggregate purchase price of $X' and an 'aggregate consideration of $Y' with the same 'consideration' tag. Concrete prevention: enforce lexical-match-first rule (if 'purchase price' appears, do not map that phrase to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1). Add a unit-test: example sentence 'aggregate purchase price of $162 million' must map to PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross; 'aggregate consideration of $1.2 billion' must map to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1.\n[err-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-patterns and prevention rules (atomic): - Anti-pattern: mapping any 'per share' price to SaleOfStockPricePerShare without checking instrument class. Prevention: before assigning SaleOfStockPricePerShare check for convertible/preferred/mandatory cues in same sentence; if present, map to convertible-specific price tag. - Anti-pattern: treating 'we sold X shares' as a generic secondary sale when underwriter/overallotment/offer language is present. Prevention: if 'we sold' co-occurs with underwriter/overallotment/overallotment exercise/offer language within ±1 sentence, treat as primary issuance and map share counts to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - Anti-pattern: applying nearest-lexical-match only. Prevention: implement precedence override: instrument-type and offering flags must be evaluated and can override nearest lexical match. - Add unit-tests for regressions: include at least 10 sentences mixing convertible language with 'per share' and 'sold' / 'offered' / 'underwriters' to ensure convertible/issuance tags win over generic sale tags.\n[err-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: err-XXXX :: Anti-pattern: blanket-mapping 'availability' -> RemainingBorrowingCapacity. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n- Do not assign RemainingBorrowingCapacity solely because the word 'availability' appears. First check for a facility-capacity anchor in same or previous sentence (\"has a $X credit facility\", \"in an aggregate principal amount of up to $X\").\n- If 'availability' is used in a comparative clause referencing a previously stated cap (\"may be less than $X\" where X == stated cap), map to MaximumBorrowingCapacity (the sentence is comparing to the contractual cap or describing an effective cap constraint).\n- If the phrase contains explicit current-amount tokens (\"amount available under the facility totaled\", \"was available under the facility\"), map to RemainingBorrowingCapacity.\n- If no anchor and no explicit remaining-amount phrase exist, mark as ambiguous and require human review instead of auto-mapping.\n- Add automated unit-tests for both positive and negative examples and log ambiguous cases for retraining.\n[err-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Tie-breaker: prefer instrument-specific mapping over generic financial-category tags when instrument anchor present (atomic prevention rule): - Anti-pattern: mapping an 'interest' currency amount to generic InterestExpense or mapping a 'per annum' percentage to a spread tag without checking instrument context. - Prevention checklist (apply in order): 1) If numeric token is percentage AND 'per annum'/'per year' present AND any instrument-anchor (note/loan/term loan/seller note) in sentence ±1 -> map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 2) If numeric token is currency AND interest lexical cue ('interest charges', 'interest expense', 'interest on') AND instrument-anchor in sentence ±1 -> map to InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument anchor). 3) If both 'spread'/'margin' and 'per annum' cues occur, prefer per-annum/stated-rate mapping; log conflict for QA. 4) If customer + revenue percent detected, map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1; do not map to generic 'percentage' tags. 5) If instrument-anchor is absent for interest-charge currency amounts, map to generic InterestExpense and flag for human review; add the sentence to a retraining queue. - Unit-tests: include all examples referenced in the above heuristics and assert instrument-specific tags beat generic alternatives.\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Atomic negation-to-zero rule for availability quantities (prevention of treating negation as 'absent' rather than numeric zero). Purpose: ensure explicit negative availability phrases ('no', 'none', 'not available') are normalized to numeric zero for quantity tags and mapped to the most specific availability tag. Rules:\n1) Negation cues (case-insensitive regex examples): /\\bno\\b/, /\\bnone\\b/, /\\bnot\\s+available\\b/, /\\bthere\\s+are\\s+no\\b/, /\\bzero\\b/ within ±6 tokens of an availability noun ('available', 'remain', 'remain\\s+available', 'available\\s+for\\s+grant').\n2) Quantity mapping: when negation cue co-occurs with availability noun and a plan/instrument anchor as applicable (e.g., 'under the Plan', 'under the facility'), assign numeric value 0 and map to the specific quantity tag (e.g., ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0; LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = $0 when explicit 'amount available under the facility was $0' or 'no availability under the credit facility').\n3) Scope constraints (do NOT apply universal zero conversion): do not convert negations that apply to non-quantity facts or idiomatic phrases ('no material impact', 'no change', 'no further details'); require proximity to a numeric/quantity noun and an anchor.\n4) Tag-type constraint: only auto-convert to zero for quantity/amount-of-shares/remaining-capacity numeric tags; do not auto-convert percentages unless explicit context indicates 'zero percent' (e.g., 'no revenue' vs 'zero percent of revenue' are different; flag ambiguous percent-negations for review).\n5) Token-window & antecedent resolution: allow antecedent anchors in previous sentence up to ±1 sentence when anaphoric phrase 'the Plan'/'the facility' is used; require confidence threshold for cross-sentence negation mapping; otherwise flag for human review.\n6) Unit-tests/examples to add:\n   - 'no shares remain available under the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan' -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0.\n   - 'There are no amounts available under the credit facility' -> LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = 0.\n   - 'No material impact was expected' -> do NOT map to any numeric tag (must be filtered by scope constraint).\n7) Logging: any auto-zero assignment should be recorded with the negation cue span and the anchor span for traceability and QA.\n[err-00004] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern prevention: Do not map currency amounts labeled as 'interest charges'/'interest expense' to generic InterestExpense when an instrument-anchor is present; instead map to InterestExpenseDebt and normalize explicit zeros. - Exact lexical cues (case-insensitive): /interest\\s+charge(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+expense(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+on\\s+the\\s+(note|notes|loan|term\\s+loan|seller\\s+note|revolver)/i. - Instrument-anchor detection: detect instrument names (Seller Notes, Term Loan, Revolver, Senior Notes, etc.) in same sentence OR previous sentence (allow antecedent resolution up to ±1 sentence and span <= 40 tokens). - Association window: currency numeric token within ±12 tokens of interest lexical cue (primary) and instrument-anchor within ±40 tokens across sentence boundary if needed. - Mapping rule: if both interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present -> assign InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument id). If interest lexical cue present but no instrument-anchor -> assign generic InterestExpense and flag 'interest-amount-no-instrument' for review. - Zero/numeric normalization: if the numeric token is explicit 'zero', 'no interest', 'none' appearing within ±6 tokens of interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present, normalize to numeric 0 and assign InterestExpenseDebt = 0; log negation cue span and anchor span for traceability. - Precedence: this instrument-specific mapping overrides any generic expense or cash-flow tag. - Unit-tests (atomic): - '$179,507 of interest charges associated with the Seller Notes for the year' -> $179,507 = InterestExpenseDebt (Seller Notes). - 'No interest expense was recorded on the Term Loan' -> InterestExpenseDebt = 0 (Term Loan), logged. - '$331,397 of interest expense for the six months ended June 30 related to the Term Loan' -> $331,397 = InterestExpenseDebt. - Logging: record instrument anchor span and interest phrase span for each mapping for QA and retraining; aggregate 'interest-amount-no-instrument' cases into review queue.\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: [err-XXXXX] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern: mapping any mention of 'Level 3' (or fair-value hierarchy) to DebtInstrumentFairValue without verifying explicit fair-value language or balance/date/VIE-listing context. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n1) Do NOT assign DebtInstrumentFairValue solely because the phrase 'Level 3' or 'Level 2' appears. Require an explicit fair-value cue ('fair value', 'measured at fair value', 'at fair value') within ±8 tokens to justify a fair-value tag.\n2) If numeric amounts are shown with date anchors ('as of', 'at [date]') or in table/note listing context or adjacent to 'VIE'/'variable interest entity' language, prefer DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount unless explicit fair-value language is present.\n3) If 'Level X' and 'fair value' both appear, map to DebtInstrumentFairValue; if 'Level X' appears with 'as of'/'included'/'carrying' map to DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount; if both classes of cues are present, log and flag for human review under 'fairvalue-vs-carrying-conflict'.\n4) Add unit-tests covering each anti-pattern and expected mapping (include the $297/$305 VIE example). 5) Log all 'level-only-ambiguous' mappings for manual QA and include them in retraining batches.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern prevention: Do NOT map any 'exercise price' + 'per share' phrase to generic price-per-share/sale tags without first checking instrument-anchor (atomic checklist):\n1) Before assigning SaleOfStockPricePerShare or generic PricePerShare: search same sentence ±1 sentence for instrument-anchor tokens: /warrant(s)?\\b/, /right(s)?\\s+to\\s+purchase\\b/, /option(s)?\\b/, /convertible\\b/. If found, prefer instrument-specific exercise-price tag (warrant/option/convertible-conversion-price) that matches anchor. \n2) If anchor == 'warrant' or 'right' -> assign ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1. If anchor == 'option' -> assign option-exercise-price tag. If anchor == 'convertible' -> assign convertible-conversion price tag. \n3) If multiple anchors (e.g., 'warrants and options') use nearest-token distance to numeric; if tie, prefer the anchor explicitly adjacent to the phrase 'exercise price' or the most-specific named instrument in sentence. \n4) If no anchor found within ±1 sentence -> DO NOT auto-assign instrument-specific tag; either (a) map to generic SaleOfStockPricePerShare only if offering/sale language strongly indicates a sale-price (e.g., 'offering price', 'issued at'), otherwise (b) flag 'exercise-price-no-instrument' for human review. \n5) Add unit-tests to cover: warrant-exercise-price, option-exercise-price, convertible-conversion-price, and exercise-price with absent instrument anchor to ensure generic-sale tags do not win by default.\n6) Logging: every time the anti-pattern would have applied (generic mapping prevented), log 'prevented-generic-exercise-price-mapping' with spans and chosen mapping reason for QA.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prevent misclassification of defined-contribution plan costs vs defined-benefit disclosures (atomic heuristic)\n- Purpose: ensure sentences describing 'net cost' or 'net contribution' of DC/defined contribution plans map to DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized (expense/contribution) and are not misclassified as defined-benefit pension items or generic pension-note amounts. \n- Exact lexical cues/patterns (case-insensitive regexes): /\\bdefined\\s+contribution\\b|\\bDC\\s+plan(s)?\\b|\\bdefined\\s+contribution\\s+plans?\\b/, net-cost cues: /\\bnet\\s+cost\\b|\\bnet\\s+contribution\\b|\\bemployer'?s?\\s+required\\s+contribution\\b|\\bwas\\s+\\$?[0-9,.]+\\b|\\bcontribution\\s+required\\b|\\bcontributed\\b/, explanatory equality cues: /=|equals|was\\s+the\\s+employer'?s?\\s+required\\s+contribution|which\\s+equals/i. \n- Association windows: require both a DC anchor and a currency numeric token in same sentence OR DC anchor in previous sentence (±1 sentence antecedent resolution allowed, span <= 40 tokens). Primary numeric-distance window = ±12 tokens around numeric for mapping. \n- Precedence & decision flow: 1) If sentence contains DC anchor + 'net cost'/'net contribution' + currency numeric -> assign DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized and link numeric to DC plan identity if present. 2) If 'net cost' appears but anchor ambiguous between DC and DB (defined benefit), prefer DC mapping only when explicit 'defined contribution'/'DC' or 'employer's required contribution' tied to contribution semantics is present; otherwise flag for human review rather than auto-mapping to DB tags. 3) If the sentence states 'net cost of the DC plans was $X and equals employer's required contribution' -> deterministically map to DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized = $X. \n- Anti-pattern prevention: do NOT assign DefinedBenefitPlanCost or pension actuarial tags when 'defined contribution' lexical cue present; do not rely on generic 'pension'/'benefit' words without explicit 'defined benefit' anchor. \n- Unit-tests/examples to add:  - 'The net cost of the DC plans for the year was $9 million, which equals the employer's required contribution.' -> $9M = DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized.  - 'Employer contributions to our defined contribution plan were $4.2M' -> $4.2M = DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized.  - 'Net pension cost for defined benefit plans was $2M' -> map to DefinedBenefitPlanCost (do not conflate). \n- Logging: record DC-anchor span, net-cost phrase span, numeric span and mapping decision; flag any auto-mapped DC cost where 'pension' or 'benefit' words also appear nearby as 'dc-vs-db-proximity' for QA.\n[err-00012] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Atomic prevention rule: Debt-amount tag consistency and 'face' vs 'carrying' precedence in amendment/borrowing disclosures. Purpose: avoid mis-tagging contractually discussed loan amounts as 'face' when the dataset maps loan disclosures to carrying/book values. Rules (apply before generic 'principal' heuristics): 1) Detect amendment/borrowing/availability disclosure contexts by lexical anchors in same sentence OR ±1 sentence: /(amend(ed|ment)|as amended|available to borrow|availability under the (?:credit )?facility|in an aggregate principal amount of up to|revolv(?:ing)? credit facility|term loan|we may borrow|commitment)/i. 2) If anchor present and numeric token denotes the instrument's stated amount in that disclosure context -> prefer DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. 3) Enforce cross-mention consistency: when two or more numeric mentions co-refer to the same instrument within ±1 sentence (match via instrument-name tokens, identical numeric value, or explicit anaphora 'the loan', 'the facility' referencing prior anchor), assign same tag to all mentions; if any prior mention was tagged CarryingAmount, propagate CarryingAmount to subsequent mentions unless an explicit 'face', 'original principal', 'originally issued' lexical cue appears. 4) Explicit cues forcing FaceAmount: map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount ONLY if proximate lexical cues present within ±8 tokens: /face amount|original principal|stated principal|original principal amount|originally issued|originally issued principal|principal amount at issuance|original issue amount/. 5) Anti-pattern prevention: do NOT map any loan-mention currency to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount by default merely because it is a principal-like dollar figure; require either explicit 'face' cues OR absence of amendment/availability/disclosure anchors AND presence of issuance/origination language. 6) Fee/currency disambiguation: if the same numeric appears both as the instrument amount and as part of a fee calculation elsewhere, do not change instrument mapping — keep instrument mapping consistent; instead map fee amounts/percents per appositive/fee-base rules. 7) Unit-tests / examples to add: - \"$20.0 million term loan (as amended)\" -> $20.0M = DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. - Repeated mentions of '$20.0 million' in adjacent sentences describing the same facility -> both = DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. - 'original principal amount of $100M' -> $100M = DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (explicit face cue). 8) Logging: record instrument-anchor span, mapping decision, and whether mapping was propagated to co-referent mentions; flag 'inconsistent-instrument-tag' cases for review.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n[ph-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Delta decision flow (apply in order for each numeric token): 1) Sentence-level scan: detect instrument-type cues (convertible/preferred/mandatory) and offering cues (underwriters, overallotment, offering language) across the sentence ±1 surrounding sentence. 2) If instrument-type == convertible: - If numeric token is a price or appears adjacent to unit tokens like 'per share', 'per common share', 'per depositary share': assign DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1 unless an explicit secondary-market sale cue is present. - If numeric token is shares and offering cues present: assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. 3) If offering cues present (even if instrument-type absent): - If numeric token is number-of-shares -> assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (primary issuance). - If numeric token is price and context uses 'offering price', 'issued at', 'offering at' -> prefer issuance-price tag (if available) else flag for review. 4) If no instrument-type or offering cues: use existing lexical-to-tag mapping (e.g., 'sold' -> SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction) as fallback. 5) Tie-breaker precedence (high -> low): instrument-specific issuance tags (convertible conversion price, mandatory-convertible issuance) > issuance/share-specific tags (StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues) > generic sale tags (SaleOfStock*). 6) Ambiguity handling: if fallback mapping would assign a generic sale tag but any instrument/offering cue matched (score difference < threshold), flag the example and record sentence+reason for human review and training. 7) Unit-test generation examples to add to test suite: - \"We sold 17,250,000 shares, including the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option\" -> 17,250,000 = StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - \"Sempra Energy 6% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, was issued at $100.00 per share\" -> $100.00 = DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1. - \"We sold 500,000 shares on the open market\" -> 500,000 = SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction.\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n[ctx-00001] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Lexical-to-tag mapping (exact cues + variants).

Sale / secondary-market indicators (inverse cues): /\\bwe sold to third parties\\b/, /\\bsecondary offering\\b/, /\\btraded on\\b/, /\\bsold on the market\\b/. Numeric association window policy: - Primary association window = ±8 tokens around numeric token. - If an instrument-type cue appears anywhere in the same sentence, treat instrument-type as global for that numeric token (i.e., instrument cues outrank local lexical matches within window). - If offering cue appears in same sentence or adjacent sentence (±1 sentence), mark transaction as primary issuance. Precedence mapping rules (applied after detection): - If instrument-type == convertible AND numeric_context == price -> map numeric to DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1 (convertible conversion/issuance price). - If offering_flag == true AND numeric_context == shares -> map numeric to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - If instrument-type == convertible AND offering_flag == true AND numeric_context == shares -> StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (shares issued in offering of convertible instrument). - Only if no instrument-type OR offering cues detected, or if explicit secondary-sale cues present, fall back to SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction / SaleOfStockPricePerShare. Distance weighting: - When multiple cues present, compute score = (instrument_cue_present ? 10 : 0) + (offering_cue_present ? 8 : 0) + (1 / (1 + token_distance_to_numeric)).

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"400,000\" in sentence: \"20 Note 10 - Goodwill and other intangible assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows : Other amortizable intangible assets were as follows : Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , was $ 400,000 and $ 600,000 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"600,000\" in sentence: \"20 Note 10 - Goodwill and other intangible assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows : Other amortizable intangible assets were as follows : Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , was $ 400,000 and $ 600,000 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"5.0\" in sentence: \"On March 23 , 2018 , Intermountain filed an application and supporting tariffs incorporating the effects of the decreases in both federal and state income taxes resulting in a decrease in revenues of approximately $ 5.0 million annually .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.8\" in sentence: \"This matter is pending before the MNPUC . MTPSC On September 25 , 2017 , Montana - Dakota filed an application with the MTPSC for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $ 2.8 million annually or approximately 4.1 percent above current rates .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1-2) The amounts $400,000 and $600,000 are explicitly labeled as \\\"Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets ... was $400,000 and $600,000, respectively.\\\" That maps directly to an amortization expense tag for intangible assets -> AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 3) The $5.0 million is described as a decrease in revenues resulting from a regulatory filing/tariff application (annual impact). The most specific tag in the taxonomy for a regulatory requested rate change (increase/decrease) amount for public utilities is PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount, so map $5.0M to that tag. 4) Likewise, the $2.8 million is described as a requested natural gas rate increase filed with the state PSC (annual impact). The specific tag PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount is the best match. No other tags (general Revenues, headline revenue) are as specific given the regulatory application context. \",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00010\",\"ctx-00004\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\"\n}",
