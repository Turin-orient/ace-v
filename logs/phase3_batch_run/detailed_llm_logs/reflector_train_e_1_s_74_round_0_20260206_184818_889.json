Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"65.7\" in sentence: \"We recognized $ 65.7 million and $ 28.4 million of stock - based compensation expense , net of actual and estimated forfeitures , associated with PRS Us on a graded vesting basis during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"28.4\" in sentence: \"We recognized $ 65.7 million and $ 28.4 million of stock - based compensation expense , net of actual and estimated forfeitures , associated with PRS Us on a graded vesting basis during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"16\" in sentence: \"Our effective tax rate was ( 16 ) % and 18 % for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 % .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"18\" in sentence: \"Our effective tax rate was ( 16 ) % and 18 % for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 % .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1–2) The amounts $65.7M and $28.4M are explicitly labeled as \\\"stock-based compensation expense\\\" recognized during the periods. Apply lexical-first expense mapping (prefer canonical line-item tag for an explicit \\\"...compensation expense\\\" phrase). Do not map to grant counts or grant-date fair-value per-share tags because the sentence quantifies expense recognized (not grants or per‑share fair value). Selected tag: ShareBasedCompensation.\\n\\n3–4) The percentages (16% and 18%) are stated as the entity's effective tax rates and the sentence explicitly compares them to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. When an effective rate is presented with an explicit reference/comparison to the federal statutory rate, map to the reconciliation tag that reflects the statutory-rate context rather than the generic effective-rate tag.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's tag choices to the ground truth and walked through the semantic match between the sentence wording and the canonical XBRL tag meanings. For the stock‑based compensation amounts ($65.7 and $28.4) the model chose the broad ShareBasedCompensation tag because the sentence literally says \\\"stock‑based compensation expense\\\". However the ground truth uses AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense, which is a more specific tag used when the filing states recognized expense amounts attributable to employee awards (i.e., expense recognized in the period and allocated to functions). For the tax rates (16% and 18%) the model picked EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate because the sentence mentions the U.S. federal statutory rate. In reality the sentence is simply reporting the entity's effective tax rates for periods (and only noting they are lower than the statutory rate), so the correct tag is the basic effective tax rate tag EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations. The model therefore over‑mapped by matching lexical cues (\\\"compensation expense\\\" -> ShareBasedCompensation; \\\"federal statutory\\\" -> reconciliation tag) without checking tag granularity and intent of the phrase.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Two specific mistakes: (1) Mapped recognized per‑period stock‑based compensation amounts to the generic ShareBasedCompensation tag instead of the more precise AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense tag. (2) Mapped a plain statement of effective tax rates (with a comparison to the statutory rate) to the reconciliation tag rather than the fundamental EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations tag.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a superficial lexical matching strategy and insufficient attention to tag specificity and reporting context. The model relied on surface keywords ('compensation expense', 'federal statutory tax rate') and chose tags that contained those keywords, instead of checking whether the sentence expressed an allocated recognized expense or a reconciliation schedule versus a simple reported rate. In short, the model confused semantic intent (reported allocated expense vs. generic item; reported effective rate vs. reconciliation detail) with mere presence of words.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"For stock‑based compensation amounts: prefer AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense when the text states an amount 'recognized' in the period attributable to share‑based awards (these are allocated/recognized expense numbers). Use the generic ShareBasedCompensation only for aggregate, disclosure‑level descriptions lacking per‑period recognized expense context. For tax rates: use EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations when the sentence reports the effective tax rate(s) for periods. Reserve EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate for passages that present a reconciliation schedule or explicit step‑by‑step comparison (i.e., a table or narrative reconciling statutory rate to effective rate with line items). Always verify tag definitions (read canonical tag label and documentation) before selecting a tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Do not rely solely on keyword presence. Determine whether the text expresses (a) an allocated/recognized expense amount vs. a general concept, and (b) a reported effective rate vs. a reconciliation schedule. Map to the most specific tag whose definition matches the reporting intent, not just the words used.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
