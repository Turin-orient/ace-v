Missing deltas: (1) an atomic 'fair-value priority' override that forces mapping numeric amounts to fair-value tags when the sentence or surrounding context explicitly discusses fair value, even if a carrying-amount phrase appears nearby; (2) an atomic 'canonical-expense-for-rent' rule that prefers the taxonomy's LeaseAndRentalExpense for 'rent'/'rental' expense disclosures unless the sentence explicitly names a taxonomy-distinct operating-lease account. Each rule must include exact lexical patterns, token/sentence association windows, instrument anchors, explicit precedence/tie-breaker behavior, and logging/unit-test prescriptions so these two failure modes are deterministically avoided and auditable.",

Without an explicit redemption-price rule (with token-windows, precedence, and make-whole disambiguation), percentages appearing in redemption clauses can be confused with stated interest rates or other percent types. Adding a focused, deterministic rule for DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage that: (1) matches redemption lexical patterns; (2) enforces association windows; (3) prefers redemption mapping over generic percentage tags; and (4) explicitly excludes/parses 'par plus make-whole' and 'make-whole premium' forms will prevent the class of pitfall described in the reflection and reduce ambiguity in future cases.",
