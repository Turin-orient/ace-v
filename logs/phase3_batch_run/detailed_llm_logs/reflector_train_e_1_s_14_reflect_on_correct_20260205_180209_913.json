Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"28\" in sentence: \"Property , Plant and Equipment The components of total property , plant and equipment , net are as follows : Depreciation expense of $ 29 million and $ 28 million was recognized in the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 respectively . Note 10 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"38\" in sentence: \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 are as follows : Other Intangible Assets Information regarding our other intangible assets is as follows : Amortization expense related to finite - lived intangible assets was $ 38 million and $ 31 million for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 are as follows : Other Intangible Assets Information regarding our other intangible assets is as follows : Amortization expense related to finite - lived intangible assets was $ 38 million and $ 31 million for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.250\" in sentence: \"The total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 463 million and $ 446 million as of March 31 , 2018 and December 31 , 2017 , respectively .

Steps and mappings: 1) Sentence 1: the phrase 'Depreciation expense of $29 million ...' explicitly labels the amount as depreciation expense.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each sentence for the numeric entity and its lexical anchor (the noun/measurement phrase that identifies what the number measures). 1) Sentence 1: 'Depreciation expense of $29 million ...' — the numeric is explicitly tied to 'Depreciation expense', so the correct US GAAP tag is Depreciation. 2) Sentence 2: 'Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $38 million ...' — the numeric is explicitly amortization of intangible assets, so AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 3) Sentence 3: The same sentence as #2 contains the prior-period amount '$31 million' which is also 'Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets', so the same tag AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets applies. 4) Sentence 4: 'we issued 2.250% Senior Notes ...' — the 2.250% is a stated coupon/interest rate on a debt instrument, so DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage is the appropriate tag.

In ambiguous cases, prefer the explicit lexical cue in the sentence or use surrounding context to disambiguate coupon vs. yield vs. fair value percentage.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map numbers to the nearest explicit measurement noun: dollar amounts labeled as 'expense' map to expense tags (Depreciation, AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets); percentages attached to debt instruments map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.
