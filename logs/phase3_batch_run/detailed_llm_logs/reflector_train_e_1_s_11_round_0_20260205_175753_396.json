Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the sentence causing the mismatch: \\\"At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our debt obligations approximated the carrying amount of $73,000.\\\" The model labeled the numeric token $73,000 as DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount because the phrase \\\"carrying amount of $73,000\\\" directly follows the number. However, the grammatical subject of the clause is \\\"the fair value of our debt obligations\\\" and the verb phrase says this fair value \\\"approximated the carrying amount of $73,000.\\\" In other words, the sentence is reporting the fair value (which is approximately $73,000). The ground truth selects LongTermDebtFairValue, meaning the reported numeric value should be mapped to the debt fair value concept. The model conflated the modifier (\\\"carrying amount\\\") with the primary measured quantity in the sentence and selected the carrying-amount tag instead of the fair-value tag. The other three predictions (FiniteLivedIntangibleAssetUsefulLife for \\\"ten\\\" and \\\"years\\\", and LeaseAndRentalExpense for \\\"3.9\\\") were correct because those tokens were unambiguously tied to the stated concept (useful life in years and rent expense amounts respectively).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model chose DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount for $73,000 instead of LongTermDebtFairValue. It mistook the nearby phrase \\\"carrying amount of $73,000\\\" as the primary measurement to tag, ignoring that the clause actually states the fair value equals (approximates) that amount — i.e., the reported figure is the fair value of long-term debt.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The error stems from a local-surface parsing mistake: the model associated the numeric token with the closest noun phrase containing a monetary label (\\\"carrying amount\\\") rather than identifying the main subject being reported (\\\"fair value of our debt obligations\\\"). Conceptually, it failed to resolve which measurement the sentence was asserting for the numeric value. There is also a subtle confusion between two closely related tags (carrying amount vs fair value) for debt, which require attention to the measurement term used in the sentence.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When mapping a numeric value to a US GAAP tag, first determine the main measurement term and the syntactic subject of the clause (e.g., \\\"fair value\\\", \\\"carrying amount\\\", \\\"carrying value\\\", \\\"face amount\\\", \\\"principal\\\"). If the sentence explicitly reports a fair value (\\\"the fair value was...\\\" or \\\"the fair value approximated... $X\\\"), pick the fair-value tag (LongTermDebtFairValue for long-term debt). Only choose DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount when the sentence explicitly states the carrying amount is $X (\\\"the carrying amount was $X\\\"). Use dependency parsing or simple heuristics (identify the head noun associated with the verb and which measurement term governs the numeric phrase) to decide which measurement the numeric refers to.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always map numeric amounts to the measurement term that is the grammatical subject/predicative of the clause (fair value vs carrying amount), not merely to the nearest monetary noun. Pay attention to verbs like \\\"was\\\", \\\"is\\\", \\\"approximated\\\", and prepositional phrases that indicate what quantity is being described.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
