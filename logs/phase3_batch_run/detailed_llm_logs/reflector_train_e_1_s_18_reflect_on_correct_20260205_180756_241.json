Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"2.75\" in sentence: \"Borrowings under this facility generally bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 0.50 percent to 2.75 percent depending on the type of loan and our credit rating .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"250.0\" in sentence: \"As of March 31 , 2018 , we were in compliance with the applicable financial and operating covenants under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility . Warehouse Credit Facility The Warehouse Credit Facility , which has a borrowing capacity of $ 250.0 million , allows for the securitization of vacation ownership notes receivable on a non - recourse basis .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"100,000,000\" in sentence: \"SHAREHOLDERS ’ EQUITY Marriott Vacations Worldwide has 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock , par value of $ 0.01 per share .?\"\n4.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and each of the four entity-to-tag mappings. For Q1 the phrase 'floating rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 0.50 percent to 2.75 percent' signals a basis spread applied to a variable-rate debt instrument, so DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1 is appropriate. For Q2 'borrowing capacity of $250.0 million' is explicitly a facility's maximum borrowing capacity, matching LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. For Q3 '100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock' is the canonical 'authorized shares' disclosure, mapping to CommonStockSharesAuthorized. For Q4 'par value of $0.01 per share' is the per-share stated/par value, mapping to CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare. Each mapping uses direct lexical cues from the sentence and matches the ground-truth tags exactly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error: the predicted answer matches the ground truth for all four items.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable—there was no mistake in concept selection, interpretation, or mapping in this case.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same approach: identify the specific financial concept expressed by the phrase (e.g., 'margin' for basis spread, 'borrowing capacity' for facility max capacity, 'authorized shares' and 'par value per share' for equity disclosures) and map it to the corresponding US GAAP tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Use precise lexical triggers to disambiguate similar tags: 'margin' or 'spread' → basis spread on variable-rate debt; 'borrowing capacity' or 'capacity of $X' → facility maximum borrowing capacity; 'authorized shares' → CommonStockSharesAuthorized; 'par value per share' or 'stated value' → CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
