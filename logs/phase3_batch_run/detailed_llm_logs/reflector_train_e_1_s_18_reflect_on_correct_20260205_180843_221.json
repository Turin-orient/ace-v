Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"2.75\" in sentence: \"Borrowings under this facility generally bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 0.50 percent to 2.75 percent depending on the type of loan and our credit rating .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"250.0\" in sentence: \"As of March 31 , 2018 , we were in compliance with the applicable financial and operating covenants under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility . Warehouse Credit Facility The Warehouse Credit Facility , which has a borrowing capacity of $ 250.0 million , allows for the securitization of vacation ownership notes receivable on a non - recourse basis .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"100,000,000\" in sentence: \"SHAREHOLDERS ’ EQUITY Marriott Vacations Worldwide has 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock , par value of $ 0.01 per share .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"0.01\" in sentence: \"SHAREHOLDERS ’ EQUITY Marriott Vacations Worldwide has 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock , par value of $ 0.01 per share .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) 2.75%: The phrase 'floating rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 0.50 percent to 2.75 percent' describes a margin/spread added to a variable index (floating rate). Per playbook rules for 'margin/plus' forms and LIBOR/ABR/variable-rate contexts, percentages expressed as a margin over a floating index map to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1 (ctx-00003, ctx-00008). 2) $250.0 million: The sentence states 'borrowing capacity of $250.0 million' for a credit facility. 'Borrowing capacity' is a facility-capacity anchor and should map to the facility maximum capacity tag, LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity (ctx-00009, ctx-00008). 3) 100,000,000 authorized shares: The phrase '100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock' is a canonical 'shares authorized' equity mapping, so use CommonStockSharesAuthorized (ctx-00001). 4) $0.01 par value per share: The phrase 'par value of $0.01 per share' is a par/stated-value-per-share mapping and should map to CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare (ctx-00001). I applied the lexical anchors and precedence rules from the playbook (margin/spread detection for variable-rate debt; facility-capacity anchors for credit facilities; equity plan/par value exact-cue rules) and selected the most specific US GAAP tags available in the provided list.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00003\",\n    \"ctx-00008\",\n    \"ctx-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00005\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step mapping and justification for each entity: 1) 2.75% — The phrase describes an \\\"applicable margin that varies from 0.50 percent to 2.75 percent\\\" added to a floating rate. This is a spread or basis applied to a variable-rate debt instrument, so the correct tag is DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. 2) $250.0 million — The sentence explicitly states \\\"borrowing capacity of $250.0 million\\\" for a credit facility. The canonical tag for a facility's maximum borrowing capacity is LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. 3) 100,000,000 authorized shares — The phrase \\\"100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock\\\" matches the standard equity tag CommonStockSharesAuthorized. 4) $0.01 par value — The phrase \\\"par value of $0.01 per share\\\" corresponds to the per-share par/stated value tag CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare. For each mapping I used lexical anchors (\\\"margin\\\", \\\"borrowing capacity\\\", \\\"authorized shares\\\", \\\"par value\\\") and selected the most specific matching US GAAP tag available.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings and final answer match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistake. However, common pitfalls that could have caused errors (but did not here) include: confusing a margin/spread with an absolute interest rate (e.g., tagging the margin as the instrument's stated interest), misreading \\\"borrowing capacity\\\" as the current balance or outstanding amount, or conflating authorized shares with issued or outstanding shares.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to: (a) identify precise lexical cues in the sentence, (b) map each cue to the most specific available US GAAP tag that matches the concept and units (percent, dollars, number of shares), and (c) avoid tagging transactional or balance amounts when the sentence refers to limits, capacities, or terms. The model followed this approach correctly for all four items.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Match lexical anchors to tag domains: \\\"margin/plus\\\" → basis/spread on variable-rate debt; \\\"borrowing capacity\\\" → facility maximum borrowing capacity; \\\"authorized shares\\\" → shares authorized tag; \\\"par value\\\" → par or stated value per share tag. Prefer the most specific tag that captures the concept and units.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
