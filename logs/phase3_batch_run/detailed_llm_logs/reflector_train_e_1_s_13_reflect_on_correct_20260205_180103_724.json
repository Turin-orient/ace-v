Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Total sales to the distributor Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates ( “ Tech Data ” ) accounted for 32 % and 31 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the three months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , and 31 % and 30 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the nine months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Total sales to the distributor Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates ( “ Tech Data ” ) accounted for 32 % and 31 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the three months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , and 31 % and 30 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the nine months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"28\" in sentence: \"In addition , Tech Data accounted for 28 % and 20 % of trade accounts receivable at October 31 , 2017 and January 31 , 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"20\" in sentence: \"In addition , Tech Data accounted for 28 % and 20 % of trade accounts receivable at October 31 , 2017 and January 31 , 2017 , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I identified that each numeric percentage quantifies the portion attributable to a single customer (Tech Data) of the company's totals: in Q1/Q2 the percentages are of \\\"total net revenue\\\" (customer concentration of revenue), and in Q3/Q4 the percentages are of \\\"trade accounts receivable\\\" (customer concentration of receivables). The playbook atomic heuristic for customer-concentration percentage mapping (ctx-00013) directs mapping percentages tied to a customer/revenue anchor to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 and gives precedence over other generic percentage tags. By extension, percentages expressing a single customer's share of receivables are also concentration metrics and best mapped to the same ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 tag. Therefore all four requested entities map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00013\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the four target numeric entities and the sentences they appear in. Each numeric value (32%, 31%, 31%, 30% in the revenue sentence; 28% and 20% in the receivable sentence) expresses a single customer’s share of a company total: the first sentence states percentages of \\\"total net revenue\\\" attributable to Tech Data for specified periods, and the second sentence states percentages of \\\"trade accounts receivable\\\" attributable to Tech Data at specific dates. The correct mapping for a single-customer concentration percentage in the US GAAP tag set provided is ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. The generator applied a single consistent heuristic (ctx-00013) mapping customer concentration percentages to this tag. That mapping is appropriate for both revenue concentration and receivables concentration in these contexts, so the predicted tags match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error: the model correctly identified the anchor (Tech Data) and the metric (percentage of a company total) and mapped those to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. The only small discrepancy in the trace is the generator referencing a playbook bullet (ctx-00013) even though the record says no playbook bullets were used; this is a documentation inconsistency rather than a tagging error.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable for a wrong tag—the reasoning and application of the heuristic were correct. The only minor issue is inconsistent bookkeeping about which playbook bullet was used in the trace.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"What the model did is the recommended approach: (1) identify the numeric as a percentage, (2) identify the denominator/anchor (total net revenue or trade accounts receivable) and the referenced counterparty (Tech Data), (3) map single-customer concentration percentages to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Maintain consistent internal bookkeeping about which playbook heuristics were applied.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a percentage quantifies a single customer’s share of a company total (revenue, receivables, etc.), map it to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Always confirm the denominator (\\\"of total net revenue\\\", \\\"of trade accounts receivable\\\") and the referenced counterparty before tagging.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ctx-00013\",\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
