Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"39.9\" in sentence: \"Excluding reimbursable revenues of $ 39.9 million , ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 46.9 percent of our International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"23.6\" in sentence: \"Excluding reimbursable revenues of $ 39.9 million , ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 46.9 percent of our International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"46.9\" in sentence: \"Excluding reimbursable revenues of $ 39.9 million , ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 46.9 percent of our International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"10.0\" in sentence: \"Our second largest customer , BP , constituted 10.0 percent of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 17.5 percent of our International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each numeric in its sentence and applied the playbook heuristics. For Q1, the phrase is \\\"reimbursable revenues of $39.9 million\\\" — lexical anchor 'revenues' directly ties the currency amount to an entity revenue measure, so map to the general Revenues tag. For Q2 (23.6%), the percent explicitly quantifies a customer's share of total consolidated revenues (\\\"ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues\\\"); per ctx-00013 (customer-concentration percentage mapping), map percentage to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. For Q3 (46.9%), although it references segment-level revenues (\\\"...of our International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues\\\"), it is still a customer concentration percent and the appropriate tag remains ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. For Q4 (10.0%), similarly this percent quantifies a single customer's share of total consolidated revenues (second largest customer) and maps to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. No other instrument or facility heuristics apply.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00013\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"Revenues,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nRevenues,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nRevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I re-read the sentence and compared the model's tag choice to the ground truth. The sentence for Q1 is: \\\"Excluding reimbursable revenues of $39.9 million, ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues ...\\\" The numeric 39.9 is explicitly labeled as \\\"reimbursable revenues\\\" and is presented as an amount of revenue (dollars). The model mapped that entity to the generic Revenues tag. The ground truth, however, is the more specific RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax tag. The rest of the predicted tags (percentages) matched the ground truth (ConcentrationRiskPercentage1). So the only mismatch is the level-of-specificity for the dollar revenue amount: the model used a generic revenue tag instead of the contract-specific revenue tag. I checked lexical cues: \\\"reimbursable revenues\\\" and the surrounding context that describes customer/segment revenue composition suggest these are contract/customer revenue amounts rather than some other revenue-like balance. The correct mapping is therefore the revenue-from-customer contract tag that excludes assessed tax, not the generic Revenues tag.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model chose the generic Revenues tag for the $39.9 amount instead of the more specific RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax. In short: wrong tag specificity—used a broad tag when a contract/customer revenue tag was appropriate.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model relied on a coarse lexical heuristic ('if the word \\\"revenues\\\" appears, map to Revenues') without checking for more specific revenue subtypes. It did not apply a priority rule that prefers contract/customer revenue tags when the context mentions reimbursable revenues or customer/contract revenue composition. In other words, the concept of 'revenue from contracts with customers (excluding assessed tax)' was not recognized as the more precise match for the phrase 'reimbursable revenues'.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Apply a specificity-first tagging rule: when a phrase explicitly refers to amounts that are revenue arising from customer contracts (keywords: reimbursable, customer, contract, excluded components, segment/customer composition), map to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (or the corresponding contract-specific revenue tag) before falling back to generic Revenues. Concretely: detect lexical anchors ('reimbursable revenues', 'constituted X percent of our total consolidated revenues') and choose the contract-customer revenue tag. Only use the generic Revenues tag when no contract/customer-specific tag matches the phrasing or when the context is clearly high-level aggregated revenue without contract/customer indicators.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Prefer the most specific applicable tag. Lexical anchors like 'reimbursable', 'customer', 'contract', 'segment revenues', 'excluding' indicate contract/customer revenue subtypes — map to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax rather than generic Revenues. Maintain an ordered priority list of revenue-related tags so specific contract/customer tags are selected before general ones.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
