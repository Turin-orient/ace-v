Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"625,000\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"5\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"6\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"83,750\" in sentence: \"In exchange for $ 75,000 cash net of fees , the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $ 83,750 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric by applying the playbook heuristics: (1) 625,000 is described as \\\"a seller financing note in the amount of $625,000\\\" — currency amount tied to an identified debt instrument (\\\"note\\\"). Per the instrument-vs-account and unit/anchor validation rules, this is the instrument face/principal amount, so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. (2) The token \\\"5\\\" appears as \\\"5% per annum\\\" describing the carrying interest rate on the note for the first twelve months; per the 'per annum' + instrument-anchor heuristic this maps to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. (3) Similarly \\\"6\\\" is \\\"6% per annum\\\" for the subsequent period, so also DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. (4) 83,750 is the principal amount of a (convertible) promissory note — a currency face amount of a debt instrument — so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. I validated units (currency vs percent) and required anchors (\\\"note\\\", \\\"per annum\\\") per the unit-and-anchor validation and interest-rate heuristics before assigning tags.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00010\", \"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00019\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the source sentences. For Q1 and Q4 the numeric values (625,000 and 83,750) are currency amounts explicitly described as promissory/seller financing notes; the appropriate tag is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount because these are face/principal amounts of debt instruments. For Q2 and Q3 the numeric values (5 and 6) are percentages followed by the phrase \\\"% per annum\\\" and are described as the carrying interest rates on the note; the appropriate tag is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage because they are stated interest rates of a debt instrument. The model applied unit-and-anchor heuristics (currency vs percent, presence of the word \\\"note\\\" or \\\"promissory note\\\", and phrasing like \\\"per annum\\\") to choose tags, and those heuristics are appropriate for these sentences. The model's final mapping matches the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and tag assignments are correct and match the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mismatch. The model correctly identified anchors (\\\"note\\\", \\\"promissory note\\\") and units (currency vs percent) and applied the proper tag mappings.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same approach: (1) identify the semantic anchor (e.g., \\\"note\\\", \\\"promissory note\\\", \\\"convertible promissory note\\\"), (2) determine the unit/type of the numeric token (currency amount, percentage, share count, etc.), (3) map to the tag that corresponds to the instrument and numeric type (e.g., face amount -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount; stated interest rate -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage). Validate that percent values tied to an interest-bearing instrument map to interest-rate tags, and currency amounts tied to an instrument map to face/ carrying/ fair-value tags as appropriate.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Key principles: (a) use lexical anchors like \\\"note\\\", \\\"loan\\\", \\\"promissory\\\" to detect debt instruments; (b) distinguish units — currency amounts => instrument face/carrying/fair-value tags, percentages with \\\"% per annum\\\" => stated interest rate tags; (c) prefer context (e.g., \\\"carrying the note at X%\\\") to choose between stated vs effective rate tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
