Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"37\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 58 million , $ 222 million and $ 37 million during the years ended December 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards granted under the 2005 ICP and 2008 Plan generally vest ratably over three to four years or at the end of five years .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"four\" in sentence: \"The employee awards generally vest ratably over three to four years .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"The employee awards generally vest ratably over three to four years .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"12.5\" in sentence: \"The Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan allows for the grant of share - based awards of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) The $37 million is explicitly described as 'total intrinsic value of options exercised' -> maps to the options exercises intrinsic-value element. 2) The word 'four' appears in the phrase 'three to four years' describing vesting duration -> map numeric endpoint to the award vesting period tag. 3) The token 'years' is the unit for the vesting duration in the same phrase -> map to the award vesting period tag (duration). 4) 'up to 12.5 million shares ... allows for the grant' is a plan authorization/maximum shares for share-based awards -> map to the plan-authorized number-of-shares tag.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I checked each entity in context and mapped its semantic meaning to the most specific US GAAP tag available. For (1) the phrase explicitly states \\\"total intrinsic value of options exercised ... $ 37 million\\\" — this directly corresponds to the options-exercises intrinsic value element. For (2) the token \\\"four\\\" appears as the upper bound in the phrase \\\"three to four years\\\" describing the vesting duration of awards — the correct mapping is the award vesting period tag (AwardVestingPeriod1). For (3) the token \\\"years\\\" is the time unit for the same vesting duration phrase and likewise maps to the award vesting period tag (duration information). For (4) \\\"up to 12.5 million shares ... allows for the grant\\\" describes an authorization/maximum number of shares for a share‑based award plan, so it maps to the NumberOfSharesAuthorized tag for the share‑based compensation arrangement. These assignments are syntactically and semantically specific and match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's predicted answers match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mismatch. Potential general pitfalls (none of which occurred here) would include: confusing a monetary intrinsic-value number with an expense or confusing an authorization limit with actual shares issued.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model followed the correct approach: identify the quantitative phrase and its modifier (e.g., \\\"intrinsic value\\\" + \\\"options exercised\\\", \\\"up to\\\" + \\\"million shares\\\", range expressed in \\\"years\\\" for vesting) and pick the most specific tag that captures that meaning. Continue to (a) prioritize semantic modifiers (exercised, granted, up to, vest) and (b) choose tags for the specific share‑based compensation concept rather than a generic numeric tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Match the numeric entity plus its semantic modifier to the most specific XBRL element: \\\"intrinsic value\\\" + \\\"exercised\\\" => options-exercises intrinsic value; numeric range with time unit => vesting period/duration tag; \\\"up to\\\" + shares => authorized number of shares. Always prefer the tag that encodes both the metric and its context (e.g., exercised, authorized, vesting).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
