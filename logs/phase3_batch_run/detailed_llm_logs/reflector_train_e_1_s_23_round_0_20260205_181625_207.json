Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"254,620\" in sentence: \"Note 8 - Share - Based Compensation In the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , as part of the annual awards under the Company ’ s Long - Term Incentive Plan , the Compensation Committee of the Company ’ s Board of Directors ( “ Compensation Committee ” ) granted 261,642 restricted stock units ( “ RSUs ” ) and 254,620 performance share awards to the Company ’ s key employees and officers under the Company ’ s 1993 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan ( “ SIP ” ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"20\" in sentence: \"The RSUs have a five - year term and vest 20 % per year commencing October 31 , 2019 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"123,812\" in sentence: \"The performance share awards comprise two separate and distinct awards with different vesting conditions . The Compensation Committee granted 123,812 performance share awards based on a relative Total Shareholder Return ( “ TSR ” ) metric over a performance period spanning November 15 , 2018 to August 31 , 2021 .?\"\n4.

Relevant heuristics: counts with explicit 'granted' map to GrantsInPeriod (ctx-00014); 'vest X% per year' is a vesting-percentage cue and maps to a vesting-rights-percentage tag (ctx-00006); 'remaining N awards' describing awards still outstanding/unvested map to a NonvestedNumber tag (ctx-00006 and ctx-00014). Unit-and-anchor validation (ctx-00010) confirms units: integers -> SHARES_COUNT allowed for grant/nonvested tags; percent -> PERCENT allowed for vesting-rights-percentage tag. Applying these: (1) 254,620 is a count of performance share awards granted under the Plan -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod. (2) 20 is a percentage vesting rate per year -> SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingRightsPercentage. (3) 123,812 is a count of performance share awards granted (TSR metric) -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod. (4) 130,808 are the remaining performance share awards (outstanding/nonvested) -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00014\",\n    \"ctx-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00010\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingRightsPercentage,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingRightsPercentage,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingRightsPercentage,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read the passage and tracked how the model mapped each numeric mention to a US GAAP tag. The model correctly mapped the first three items: 254,620 and 123,812 are counts of performance share awards that were part of grants, and 20 is a vesting percent. The mistake occurred on the fourth item, 130,808. The sentence says “The remaining 130,808 performance share awards have a three‑year performance period…”. Earlier the note clearly stated that 254,620 performance share awards were granted in the period. The passage then splits that granted pool into two groups: 123,812 (TSR awards) and the remaining 130,808 (three‑year performance awards). So 130,808 is not describing an outstanding/nonvested balance separate from the grant; it is the second component of the originally granted awards. The model treated the word “remaining” as a cue for “outstanding/nonvested number” and assigned ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber. That mapping misreads the discourse function of “remaining” here — it signals the remainder of the grant allocation, not necessarily a statement about vesting status or outstanding balance. Because the sentence context includes an explicit grant event earlier, the correct tag for 130,808 is the same grants-in-period tag used for the other award counts.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified 130,808 as a NonvestedNumber because it interpreted “remaining” to mean unvested/outstanding. In reality the passage is splitting a previously described grant into two groups, so 130,808 is part of the grants in period and should be tagged as GrantsInPeriod.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Two related issues caused the error: (1) a local heuristic overgeneralization — the model had a brittle rule that ‘remaining N awards’ implies a current outstanding/nonvested count, and applied it without checking prior sentences; (2) insufficient cross-sentence linking — the model failed to connect the earlier sentence that explicitly said the awards were granted in the period to the later sentence that partitions those granted awards. Conceptually, the model conflated 'remaining (of a grant)' with 'remaining outstanding/nonvested', which are different semantic roles.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Before assigning NonvestedNumber, check whether the text links the number to a grant event (e.g., 'granted', 'the Company granted X awards') or instead describes vesting/outstanding status (e.g., 'nonvested', 'outstanding', 'unvested', 'vested/unvested balance'). If the number is a component of an explicitly described grant (as here where 254,620 grants are split into 123,812 and 130,808), use the GrantsInPeriod tag. Only use NonvestedNumber when the text explicitly indicates nonvested/outstanding status or when the sentence context unambiguously refers to outstanding awards rather than allocations of a grant.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map counts to GrantsInPeriod when the narrative describes awards granted or splits of a grant; reserve NonvestedNumber for explicit statements about unvested/outstanding awards. Always resolve cross-sentence references: if earlier text reports a grant, later numeric splits of that grant usually inherit the grants-in-period semantics.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
