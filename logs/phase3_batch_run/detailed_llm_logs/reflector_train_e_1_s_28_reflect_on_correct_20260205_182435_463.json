Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"703,000\" in sentence: \"Stockholders ’ Equity Treasury Stock In the first quarter of 2017 , the Company paid $ 14,402,000 for repurchases of its common stock ; and of that amount , 703,000 shares of its common stock were repurchased in private transactions for an aggregate cost of $ 13,975,000 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"10\" in sentence: \"A ) IHC Share - Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of IHC ’ s share - based compensation plans : ( i ) the exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and the terms of an option may not exceed 10 years from the grant date ; and ( ii ) the exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and SAR terms may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"10\" in sentence: \"A ) IHC Share - Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of IHC ’ s share - based compensation plans : ( i ) the exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and the terms of an option may not exceed 10 years from the grant date ; and ( ii ) the exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and SAR terms may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"1,133,100\" in sentence: \"At March 31 , 2017 , there were 1,133,100 shares available for future stock - based compensation grants under IHC ’ s stock incentive plan .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: Sentence states '703,000 shares ... were repurchased ...' — lexical cue 'repurchased' is a repurchase/treasury transaction. Per transaction-direction guard (repurchase cues -> treasury stock mapping) the numeric count of shares repurchased should map to TreasuryStockSharesAcquired. Q2: Phrase 'terms of an option ... may not exceed 10 years from the grant date' — this is an expiration/term length for awards (option maximum term). Map numeric years to the share-based compensation expiration/term tag. Best match in taxonomy: SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. Q3: Same sentence for SARs (same semantic: maximum term = expiration period). Use same tag as Q2: SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. Q4: '1,133,100 shares available for future stock-based compensation grants under IHC’s stock incentive plan' — lexical cues 'available for ... grants' + plan anchor -> map to plan-availability tag ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. Summary of chosen tags in order: Q1 -> TreasuryStockSharesAcquired; Q2 -> SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod; Q3 -> SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod; Q4 -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. No numerical calculation required beyond matching lexical cues and applying plan/repurchase heuristics.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"err-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00010\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"TreasuryStockSharesAcquired,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nTreasuryStockSharesAcquired,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nTreasuryStockSharesAcquired,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each question and the model's mapping to US GAAP taxonomy tags. Q1: The sentence explicitly states a count of shares repurchased (\\\"703,000 shares ... repurchased\\\"), which corresponds to the number of treasury shares acquired; the appropriate tag is TreasuryStockSharesAcquired. Q2 and Q3: Both refer to the maximum permissible term of options and SARs (\\\"may not exceed 10 years\\\"), i.e., an award expiration/term measured in years; the correct tag is SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. Q4: The sentence states a count of shares available for future grants (\\\"1,133,100 shares available for future stock-based compensation grants\\\"), which maps to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. I verified units (shares vs years) and lexical cues (repurchased, may not exceed, available for future grants) to choose the tags. The predicted tags match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No errors were made.
