Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"5.9\" in sentence: \"This matter is pending before the MTPSC . NDPSC On July 21 , 2017 , Montana - Dakota filed an application with the NDPSC for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $ 5.9 million annually or approximately 5.4 percent above current rates .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.2\" in sentence: \"On March 9 , 2018 , Montana - Dakota submitted a request to decrease its electric rates by $ 7.2 million or 3.9 percent annually .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"2.3\" in sentence: \"This matter is pending before the OPUC . On May 31 , 2018 , Cascade filed a general rate case with the OPUC requesting an overall increase of approximately $ 2.3 million or approximately 3.5 percent on an annual basis , which incorporates the impact of the TCJA .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"1.2\" in sentence: \"On January 22 , 2019 , Cascade filed a stipulation with the OPUC for an annual increase in revenues of $ 1.7 million with a $ 500,000 reduction for excess deferred income taxes , for a net increase of $ 1.2 million .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read each sentence and applied lexical cue mapping: the phrases 'filed an application ... for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $5.9 million', 'submitted a request to decrease its electric rates by $7.2 million', 'filed a general rate case ... requesting an overall increase of approximately $2.3 million', and 'filed a stipulation ... for a net increase of $1.2 million' all identify regulatory requests for rate changes with explicit currency amounts. The appropriate US GAAP element for requested utility rate changes is PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount. For the fourth sentence the net number ($1.2M) is the final requested change after adjustments, so it maps to the same tag. I therefore mapped each numeric entity to PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\", \"misc-00002\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nPublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nPublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?]\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"[What should the model have done instead?]\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"[What strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?]\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"calc-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"fin-00002\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined each sentence for the semantic role of the numeric amounts. All four amounts are described as regulatory requests or filings (phrases: \\\"filed an application ... for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $5.9 million\\\", \\\"submitted a request to decrease its electric rates by $7.2 million\\\", \\\"filed a general rate case ... requesting an overall increase of approximately $2.3 million\\\", and \\\"filed a stipulation ... for a net increase of $1.2 million\\\"). These are not general revenue figures or accounting entries but explicit requested rate adjustments made to a public utility commission. The correct US GAAP tag for requested utility rate increases or decreases is PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount. The fourth sentence uses a net amount after adjustments, which still represents the requested change in rates, so the same tag applies. Therefore mapping each numeric entity to PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount is correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error: the model correctly identified the context (regulatory rate requests) and selected the appropriate tag for each numeric amount. There is no mismatch between predicted answers and ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable (no incorrect reasoning). A potential source of mistakes in similar tasks would be confusing regulatory requested amounts with realized revenues, expense line-items, or other finance tags (for example, mapping to Revenues or ContractWithCustomerLiability), but that did not occur here.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) identify verbs indicating a regulatory action (filed, requested, submitted, stipulation), (2) confirm the numeric amount is described as an increase/decrease in rates (not a revenue or expense), and (3) map to PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount. If the sentence described an approved rate change or recognized revenue, choose a different tag accordingly.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a monetary amount is explicitly tied to a regulatory filing/request for rate increase or decrease (look for words like \\\"filed\\\", \\\"requested\\\", \\\"rate increase/decrease\\\"), use the PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount tag; distinguish requested amounts from recognized revenue/expense by verifying the action (request/filed vs. approved/recognized).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
