Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"350.0\" in sentence: \"We expect adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities between $ 250.0 and $ 350.0 as of January 1 , 2019 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"634.8\" in sentence: \"Net sales to customers located outside the United States totaled $ 634.8 , $ 627.1 and $ 655.6 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"627.1\" in sentence: \"Net sales to customers located outside the United States totaled $ 634.8 , $ 627.1 and $ 655.6 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"655.6\" in sentence: \"Net sales to customers located outside the United States totaled $ 634.8 , $ 627.1 and $ 655.6 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) The sentence states recognition of \\\"additional lease assets and lease liabilities between $250.0 and $350.0.\\\" The numeric $350.0 is the upper bound of an amount describing lease assets/liabilities. Map to the lease asset tag because the phrase explicitly mentions \\\"lease assets\\\" and the taxonomy contains OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset as the specific asset tag for recognized lease assets. 2-4) The phrase \\\"Net sales to customers located outside the United States totaled $634.8, $627.1 and $655.6 for 2018, 2017 and 2016\\\" are revenue amounts by year. Prefer the more specific revenue-from-contract tag rather than a generic Revenues tag because these are net sales (contract revenue) amounts; therefore map each year’s amount to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax. I verified the wording: \\\"net sales\\\" = revenue from contracts with customers and no assessed tax is mentioned, so the ExcludingAssessedTax variant is appropriate. I applied the tie-breaker principle to prefer the specific instrument/line-item tag over a generic Revenues tag.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"err-00014\",\n    \"ctx-00013\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nOperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nOperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax,RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the ground truth. The question asked for four US GAAP tags corresponding to four numeric entities in two sentences. For the first entity (\\\"350.0\\\") the sentence explicitly referred to \\\"recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities between $250.0 and $350.0 as of January 1, 2019.\\\" The model mapped the upper bound amount to OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset, which is a precise tag for recognized lease assets under the new lease accounting standard. For the three amounts in the second sentence (\\\"634.8, 627.1 and 655.6 for 2018, 2017 and 2016\\\") the text described them as \\\"Net sales to customers located outside the United States,\\\" which are sales/revenue amounts. The model selected RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax for each amount, correctly interpreting \\\"net sales\\\" as contract revenue and choosing the taxonomy variant that excludes assessed tax (no assessed tax was mentioned). The environment feedback shows the predicted tags exactly match the ground truth, so the model's mapping and justification were correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error occurred: the model's tag choices match the ground truth. There is no mismatch between predicted answer and target.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no incorrect mapping. The model correctly interpreted the context: recognized lease assets/liabilities -> OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset; net sales to customers (by year) -> RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same approach: 1) read the phrase surrounding an amount to determine the accounting concept (e.g., lease asset vs lease liability, revenue/net sales), 2) prefer the most specific taxonomy element that matches the concept and context (e.g., lease right-of-use asset tag for recognized lease assets, revenue-from-contract-with-customer tag for net sales), and 3) ensure the year association is preserved when multiple amounts are listed. When a sentence mentions both assets and liabilities with a numeric range, confirm whether the amount is being used to quantify assets, liabilities, or both; choose the tag that best fits the wording.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map numeric amounts to tags by focusing on the explicit accounting concept in the surrounding text. Prefer specific taxonomy elements over generic ones when the context matches (e.g., OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAsset for recognized lease assets; RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax for net sales when assessed tax isn't discussed). When ranges mention both assets and liabilities, verify which side the amount is quantifying or whether separate tags are needed.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
