Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"The terms of options granted under the 2010 Plan may not exceed ten years .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"four\" in sentence: \"Additionally , the 2015 Plan provides for the grant of cash - based awards . Options granted generally vest over a period of four years .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"Additionally , the 2015 Plan provides for the grant of cash - based awards . Options granted generally vest over a period of four years .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"three\" in sentence: \"All other options typically vest in equal monthly installments over the four - year vesting schedule . RSUs generally vest over a period of three years .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I applied the playbook temporal and equity/share-based heuristics. 1) Sentence: 'The terms of options ... may not exceed ten years.' The governing noun is 'terms'/'may not exceed ... years' indicating option expiration/term (ctx-00010: prefer term/expiration mapping over vesting). The exact taxonomy element for expiration is SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. 2) Sentence: 'Options granted generally vest over a period of four years.' The numeric 'four' is linked to the governing noun 'vest ... period' → vesting period (ctx-00010). The appropriate vesting tag in the provided taxonomy is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1. 3) Same sentence as (2): the token 'years' likewise refers to the vesting period, so the same vesting tag applies (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1). 4) Sentence: '... RSUs generally vest over a period of three years.' Instrument-class-first rule (identify RSUs as non-option award) then temporal rule: 'vest over a period of three years' → vesting period. The generic award-vesting-period tag covers RSUs as well, so use ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1. I prioritized governing-noun patterns (term vs vest) and instrument-class disambiguation per the playbook to choose expiration vs vesting tags.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00010\", \"ctx-00007\", \"ctx-00008\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nSharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nSharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the mapping between the text and the US GAAP taxonomy. For Q1 the phrase 'may not exceed ten years' modifies the option 'terms' and clearly refers to the option expiration/term, not vesting; the taxonomy element that captures an award expiration/term is SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod — so that mapping is correct. For Q2 and Q3 the clause 'vest over a period of four years' contains the verb 'vest' and a period measurement, which corresponds to an award vesting period; the taxonomy element used (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1) correctly captures vesting-period measurements. For Q4 the sentence explicitly says 'RSUs generally vest over a period of three years'; again 'vest' + 'period' indicates vesting period, and the same vesting-period tag applies (the award-type-general vesting tag covers options and non-option awards like RSUs). The model applied governing-noun/verb heuristics and instrument-class rules consistently, producing outputs that match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error — the predicted tags match the ground truth exactly. There are no mismatches between chosen tags and the intended semantics in the sentences.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because the model's reasoning and tag selection were correct. A potential source of error in similar tasks would be confusing 'term/expiration' with 'vesting' when both temporal words appear in proximity, but that confusion did not occur here.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should continue to (a) identify the governing verb/noun (e.g., 'vest' vs 'term/expire'), (b) map 'term/expire/may not exceed' to expiration/term taxonomy elements and map 'vest/vesting/vest over a period' to vesting-period elements, and (c) apply instrument-class rules only when they change the tag (e.g., different tags for option-expiration vs award-vesting only when taxonomy distinguishes them). In this instance the model followed that approach correctly.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map semantics, not surface tokens: 'may not exceed X years' -> expiration/term tag; 'vest over a period of X years' -> vesting-period tag. Use the governing verb (expire/term vs vest) and the award type only when the taxonomy differentiates by instrument.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"bullet_id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"bullet_id\": \"ctx-00007\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"bullet_id\": \"ctx-00008\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"bullet_id\": \"ctx-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
