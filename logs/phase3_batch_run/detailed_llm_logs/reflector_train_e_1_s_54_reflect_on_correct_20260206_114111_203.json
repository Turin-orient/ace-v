Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"3.88\" in sentence: \"The fair values of the 3.88 % and 5.00 % notes are based on quoted market prices and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"5.00\" in sentence: \"The fair values of the 3.88 % and 5.00 % notes are based on quoted market prices and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"3.88\" in sentence: \"The carrying amounts , which are net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts , and fair values of the 3.88 % notes and 5.00 % notes are as follows , please see further details at Note 8 - Debt : 22 Table of Contents 11 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"5.00\" in sentence: \"The carrying amounts , which are net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts , and fair values of the 3.88 % notes and 5.00 % notes are as follows , please see further details at Note 8 - Debt : 22 Table of Contents 11 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Summary of decision: Each numeric token (3.88% and 5.00%) is a stated coupon/interest rate attached to debt instruments ('notes' appears in the same sentence). Per the interest-rate instrument-anchor heuristic (require an instrument anchor like 'note(s)' and a percent token to map to an instrument interest-rate tag) the correct mapping is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. I ruled out basis/spread tags because there are no 'LIBOR', 'margin', 'plus' or 'spread' cues; I also ignored fair-value/carrying-amount context since those describe valuation, not the percent's semantic role as the stated note interest rate. Applied rules: detect percent + instrument-anchor -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage; spread/margin rules not triggered. Same mapping applies in both sentences (fair-value context or carrying-amount table) for both percentages.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"err-00014\",\n    \"ctx-00003\",\n    \"ctx-00012\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined the sentences and focused on the numeric tokens 3.88% and 5.00% and their lexical environment. In each sentence the percent token is immediately tied to the word 'notes' (instrument anchor). That pattern — a percent number directly modifying a debt instrument ('note(s)') — semantically denotes the stated coupon/interest rate of the debt. Alternative tags (for example spread, basis, fair value amounts, or carrying amounts) are not signaled by the wording: there are no words like 'spread', 'basis', 'margin', or 'yield' nor is the percent presented as a fair value amount. Therefore the correct US GAAP tag is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage for each of the four entities. The model applied the percent+instrument-anchor heuristic consistently and correctly in both the valuation (Level 2 fair value) and carrying-amount contexts.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error — the model's reasoning and final tag assignments match the ground truth. There were no mislabels or calculation mistakes.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistake. A potential minor risk (not realized here) is overfocusing on surrounding context words like 'fair values' or 'carrying amounts' and misclassifying a percent as a valuation metric; the model avoided that by prioritizing the percent + debt-instrument anchor relation.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the instrument-anchor heuristic: when a percent immediately modifies or is tied to a debt instrument (notes, bonds, etc.), tag it as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Only consider alternative tags (e.g., spread, effective rate) if explicit cues such as 'spread', 'basis points', 'effective', 'yield', or references to floating rate indices are present.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Rule of thumb: percent tokens coupled with a debt instrument noun (note, bond) → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Look for explicit cues (spread/margin/yield/effective) before assigning spread/basis/effective-rate tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
