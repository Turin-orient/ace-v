Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"750\" in sentence: \"If the Borrowers obtain the full amount of the additional increases in commitments , the Revolving Credit Facility will allow borrowings of up to $ 750 million .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"30\" in sentence: \"Letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $ 30 million are also available under the Revolving Credit Agreement , which would reduce the amount of the revolving loans available under the Revolving Credit Facility .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"335\" in sentence: \"The Revolving Credit Agreement amends and restates the Borrowers ’ existing $ 335 million secured revolving credit facility , dated October 10 , 2017 , as amended .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"1.75\" in sentence: \"The Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part from time to time without penalty or premium , but including all breakage costs incurred by any lender thereunder . The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for interest on the loans at a rate per annum equal to ( i ) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent , with the amount of such margin determined based upon the average of the Borrowers ’ excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as calculated by the administrative agent , for loans based on LIBOR , or ( ii ) the administrative agent ’ s base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent , with the amount of such margin determined based upon the average of the Borrowers ’ excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as calculated by the administrative agent , for loans based on the base rate .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I applied the playbook credit-facility and LIBOR-spread heuristics to map each numeric entity to the most specific US GAAP tag:\\n\\n1) \\\"$750 million\\\" described as \\\"allow borrowings of up to $750 million\\\" is a stated facility cap/maximum borrowing amount.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the four mapping decisions. For each numeric entity the model correctly (a) identified the semantic role of the number in its sentence and (b) mapped that role to the most specific US GAAP tag available in the provided list. Detailed rationale:\\n\\n1) \\\"$750 million\\\" appears in \\\"allow borrowings of up to $750 million.\\\" The phrase \\\"up to\\\" signals a maximum borrowing capacity for the facility, so LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity is the precise tag.\\n\\n2) \\\"$30 million\\\" appears in \\\"Letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $30 million are also available...\\\" The phrase explicitly mentions letters of credit and an available/aggregate amount, so LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount is the correct tag.\\n\\n3) \\\"$335 million\\\" describes the size of an existing secured revolving credit facility (\\\"existing $335 million secured revolving credit facility\\\"). This is the facility commitment/maximum, so LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity is again appropriate.\\n\\n4) \\\"1.75 percent\\\" is the lower bound of a LIBOR-based margin expressed as \\\"LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent.\\\" That is a basis spread applied to a variable rate loan, so DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1 is the correct tag.\\n\\nAll four mappings match the ground truth. I verified that the model did not confuse percentage spreads with principal amounts or mistakenly pick broader/less specific tags (e.g., generic DebtInstrumentFaceAmount or InterestExpense).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error: the model's mappings are correct and match the ground truth for all four items.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no incorrect reasoning in this instance. The model applied the relevant heuristics correctly (\\\"up to\\\" -> facility capacity; explicit mention of letters of credit -> letters-of-credit tag; \\\"LIBOR plus X%\\\" -> variable-rate basis spread).\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same approach: (1) parse the immediate lexical cues (e.g., \\\"up to,\\\" \\\"aggregate,\\\" \\\"letters of credit,\\\" \\\"LIBOR plus\\\"), (2) determine whether the number is a principal/commitment amount, an available/issued letters-of-credit amount, or a percentage spread, and (3) select the most specific matching US GAAP tag (prefer tags with explicit facility/letters/spread semantics over generic ones). Also validate units (USD vs percent) and the object being described (facility vs instrument vs expense).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map lexical cues to tag classes: \\\"up to\\\" -> maximum borrowing capacity; \\\"letters of credit\\\" -> LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount; percent expressed as a margin like \\\"LIBOR plus X%\\\" -> DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1.
