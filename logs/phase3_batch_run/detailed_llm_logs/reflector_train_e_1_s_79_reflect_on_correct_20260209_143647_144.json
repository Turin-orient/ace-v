Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"5\" in sentence: \"The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are 2 to 5 years for equipment and furniture and fixtures .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"0.37\" in sentence: \"On February 28 , 2017 , the Company issued a ten year warrant to purchase 1,440,501 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.37 per share .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"0.65\" in sentence: \"On August 31 , 2017 , the Company issued a ten year warrant to purchase 112,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.65 per share .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"0.60\" in sentence: \"In lieu of fees for these consulting services , on September 1 , 2017 , the Company issued ten year warrants to purchase 374,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.60 per share .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Sentence 1: 'The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are 2 to 5 years for equipment and furniture and fixtures.' Key lexical cue = 'useful lives' and 'depreciable assets' (property, plant & equipment). The numeric '5' is an endpoint of the useful-life range for depreciable (PPE) assets, so map to PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife. 2) Sentence 2: '...warrant ... exercise price of $0.37 per share.' Lexical cues = 'exercise price' + 'per share' + warrant instrument. The most specific tag for warrants/rights exercise price is ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1, so map 0.37 to that tag. 3) Sentence 3: same pattern as #2 for $0.65 per share warrant exercise price -> ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1. 4) Sentence 4: same pattern as #2 for $0.60 per share warrants issued for consulting fees -> ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1. I applied instrument/per-share lexical mapping heuristics (identify 'exercise price' + 'per share' and warrant anchor) and mapped PPE useful-life wording to the PPE useful-life tag. Double-checked tag list to choose the specific warrant-exercise-price tag and the PPE useful-life tag. \",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ph-00006\", \"ctx-00005\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nPropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nPropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1,ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace: it correctly identified lexical cues in each sentence and mapped them to the appropriate US GAAP tags. For sentence 1 the cues 'useful lives' and 'depreciable assets' point to property, plant and equipment useful life, so PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife is appropriate. For sentences 2–4 the phrase 'exercise price' combined with 'per share' and the fact that the instruments are warrants point to the specialized warrant exercise-price tag ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1. The model consistently applied the rule: (1) detect the accounting concept from lexical anchors; (2) find the most specific matching tag from the provided list. The predicted answers exactly match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and tag selection were correct and matched the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistaken inference or mapping. The model recognized domain cues and selected the specific, correct tags.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same procedure: identify strong lexical anchors (e.g., 'useful lives' → PPE useful life; 'exercise price'/'per share' + 'warrant' → warrant exercise-price tag). When multiple tags could apply, prefer the most specific tag that directly references the described concept (e.g., the dedicated warrant-exercise-price tag instead of a generic price or share tag). Verify the tag list for similarly named tags to avoid ambiguity.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map textual accounting cues to tags by (a) recognizing exact accounting phrases (e.g., 'useful lives', 'exercise price'), (b) preferring the most specific tag available, and (c) double-checking instrument context (warrant vs. option vs. other equity instruments) to choose the correct exercise-price or instrument tag.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
