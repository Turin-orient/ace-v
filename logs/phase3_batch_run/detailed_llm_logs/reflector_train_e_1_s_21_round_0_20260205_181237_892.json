Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"5.1\" in sentence: \"The following table reflects these intangible assets by major category : Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 7.7 million , $ 5.1 million and $ 7.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.9\" in sentence: \"The following table reflects these intangible assets by major category : Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 7.7 million , $ 5.1 million and $ 7.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"400\" in sentence: \"Debt and Credit Agreements In November 2016 , the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility ( the “ Senior Secured Credit Facility ” ) , consisting of a $ 400 million revolving credit facility ( the \" Revolving Credit Facility \" ) and a $ 550 million term loan facility ( the \" Term Loan Facility \" ) .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"550\" in sentence: \"Debt and Credit Agreements In November 2016 , the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility ( the “ Senior Secured Credit Facility ” ) , consisting of a $ 400 million revolving credit facility ( the \" Revolving Credit Facility \" ) and a $ 550 million term loan facility ( the \" Term Loan Facility \" ) .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Sentence: 'Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 7.7 million , $ 5.1 million and $ 7.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.' The numeric 5.1 (for 2017) is explicitly labeled as 'Amortization expense for intangible assets' so the most specific US GAAP tag is AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 2) The numeric 7.9 (for 2016) is the same series and likewise maps to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. (Lexical exact-match to the expense phrase drives the mapping.) 3) Sentence: 'consisting of a $ 400 million revolving credit facility ...' A revolving credit facility size is a facility maximum/commitment amount. Per the playbook rules for credit facilities, currency amounts stating facility size map to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. Therefore $400 million -> LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. 4) Sentence: '... and a $ 550 million term loan facility ( the \\\" Term Loan Facility \\\" ) .' A term loan facility amount is the face/principal amount of the debt instrument; per the aggregate/principal-amount heuristic, map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. Thus $550 million -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00008\", \"ctx-00009\", \"ctx-00005\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared each predicted tag to the ground truth and traced the model's mapping decisions. The model correctly mapped both 5.1 and 7.9 (amortization expense amounts) to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets because the sentence explicitly labels these values as \\\"Amortization expense for intangible assets.\\\" The model also correctly mapped 550 (the term loan amount) to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount because a term loan principal maps to a debt instrument face amount. The only mismatch is the third item: the model mapped \\\"$400 million revolving credit facility\\\" to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity, while the ground truth is LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity. The model applied a heuristic that any stated facility size equals the facility's maximum/commitment amount. However, the sentence simply describes the size of the revolving credit facility at inception (\\\"a $400 million revolving credit facility\\\"), which in the labeling convention used here corresponds to the facility's current borrowing capacity rather than the explicit concept of \\\"maximum borrowing capacity.\\\"\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model chose LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity for the $400 million revolving credit facility when the correct tag is LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The error arose from a semantic misinterpretation of the phrase \\\"a $400 million revolving credit facility.\\\" The model conflated the facility amount with the concept of a facility's maximum or committed size. It applied an over-broad heuristic (\\\"facility size -> maximum borrowing capacity\\\") without checking lexical cues or dataset/tagging conventions that distinguish current borrowing capacity from maximum/commitment amounts.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Map the $400 million revolving credit facility to LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity. Use lexical cues and tagging conventions: when a sentence states the size of a facility (e.g., \\\"a $X revolving credit facility,\\\" \\\"consisting of a $X facility\\\") and no modifier like \\\"maximum,\\\" \\\"commitment,\\\" or \\\"unused capacity\\\" appears, prefer the CurrentBorrowingCapacity tag. Reserve the MaximumBorrowingCapacity tag for explicit language about maximum/committed limits (words like \\\"maximum,\\\" \\\"commitment,\\\" \\\"facility maximum,\\\" or references to the lender's committed amount).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish facility amount semantics: absence of explicit 'maximum' or 'commitment' language typically indicates current borrowing capacity rather than maximum capacity. Rely on exact lexical cues (maximum, commitment, remaining, unused) to choose between LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity and LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
