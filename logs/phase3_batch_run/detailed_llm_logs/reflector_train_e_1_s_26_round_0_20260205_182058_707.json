Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"546,440\" in sentence: \"Lastly , the Company issued three notes totaling $ 546,440 , which represented the remaining outstanding debt of CRA that was not included as part of the sale of U.S. Operations at March 31 , 2016 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"2,254,500\" in sentence: \"India Office Building Mortgage In May 2014 , My Mobile Payments Limited obtained a $ 2,254,500 loan with Union Bank of India to purchase an office building to be used as its headquarters .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"16\" in sentence: \"The loan was interest only for the first six months at the rate of 16 % per annum .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"15\" in sentence: \"Thereafter , the interest rate is 15 % per annum , and principal and interest payments are to be made in 26 equal quarterly payments .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) 'issued three notes totaling $546,440' — this is an issuance of debt instruments where the numeric is the aggregate principal/face amount of the notes. The best-fit US GAAP tag is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (maps currency amounts stating face/aggregate principal of notes). I applied the principal/aggregate -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount heuristic (ctx-00008) and used the presence of the debt-instrument anchor 'notes' and the verb 'issued' to link the numeric to face amount. 2) '$2,254,500 loan ... obtained ... to purchase an office building' — this is the principal amount of a loan (debt instrument). The numeric likewise represents the face/aggregate principal amount of the loan; map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. I used the same principal/aggregate debt-instrument mapping (ctx-00008) with the loan anchor. 3) 'rate of 16% per annum' — the percent is an annual stated interest rate on the loan (interest-only period); per the 'per annum' + instrument-anchor rule, map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (ctx-00011). 4) 'the interest rate is 15% per annum' — same reasoning as (3): 'per annum' with loan instrument anchor -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (ctx-00011). Summary of applied playbook heuristics: principal/aggregate face-amount mapping for debt instruments (ctx-00008) for Q1–Q2; 'per annum' instrument-rate mapping (ctx-00011) for Q3–Q4.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00008\",\"ctx-00011\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLongTermDebt,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's mapping decisions to the ground truth and the sentence contexts. For Q1 the sentence says: \\\"issued three notes totaling $546,440, which represented the remaining outstanding debt of CRA...\\\" The numeric is described as the \\\"remaining outstanding debt\\\" (a balance/ liability classification), not merely the face amount of an individual instrument. The ground truth label LongTermDebt reflects that the paragraph is describing an outstanding debt balance (likely presented on the balance sheet) rather than simply labeling instrument-level principal. For Q2 the phrase \\\"obtained a $2,254,500 loan\\\" clearly names the loan principal and maps to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (the model's choice was correct). For Q3 and Q4 the phrases \\\"rate of 16% per annum\\\" and \\\"interest rate is 15% per annum\\\" directly indicate the stated interest rates of the debt instruments; DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage is the correct mapping (model correct). Overall the model correctly handled instrument-rate mappings and a straightforward loan principal, but mis-applied the face-amount heuristic in Q1 where the text signals a balance-sheet classification (LongTermDebt) rather than an instrument-level face amount.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model labeled Q1 as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount instead of LongTermDebt. It focused on the token \\\"notes\\\" and the heuristic that numeric amounts next to 'notes/loan' indicate face amount, and failed to incorporate the phrase \\\"remaining outstanding debt,\\\" which indicates an aggregate long-term liability classification.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a misapplied heuristic: the model treated any amount adjoining debt-instrument language as a face/ principal amount (instrument-level tag) without checking whether the sentence frames the amount as an outstanding balance/ liability classification. It conflated 'issued three notes totaling $X' with 'this is the face amount of instruments' even though the sentence explicitly positions the amount as the remaining outstanding debt of the entity (a balance-sheet item). This reveals a conceptual gap between 'instrument principal' and 'liability balance classification.'\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Determine whether the numeric amount is being presented as (a) an instrument-level principal/face amount for a specific issuance or (b) an aggregate outstanding liability (balance-sheet line). If the sentence frames the amount as 'outstanding', 'remaining debt', or part of the entity's liabilities, prefer a balance-sheet classification tag such as LongTermDebt. Use DebtInstrumentFaceAmount only when the text treats the amount as the principal of a specific instrument or issuance without implying a balance-sheet classification. Practically: (1) scan for keywords like 'outstanding', 'remaining', 'balance', 'reported as', 'long-term', 'noncurrent' to indicate liability classification; (2) if text instead says 'obtained a $X loan' or 'issued notes totaling $X' but in a purely transactional description, consider DebtInstrumentFaceAmount; (3) when ambiguous, prefer the more general/financial-statement classification that the sentence implies.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Differentiate 'instrument principal/face amount' from 'liability/balance-sheet classification.' The same numeric can be mapped to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount when it denotes a specific instrument's principal, or to LongTermDebt (or similar liability tags) when it denotes an outstanding debt balance. Always check nearby modifiers like 'outstanding', 'remaining', 'balance', or explicit presentation cues to choose between these tag families.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00008\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
