Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"50.0\" in sentence: \"The maturity date for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility is October 31 , 2022 . With respect to the revolving credit facility , the entire amount available may be used by Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in U.S. dollars and certain alternative currencies , up to $ 600.0 million may be used by certain subsidiaries of Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies , up to $ 100.0 million may be used for swing line loans in U.S. dollars , up to $ 50.0 million may be used for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to $ 30.0 million ( increased to $ 50.0 million pursuant to the October 2018 amendment ) may be used for swing line loans in Australian dollars .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"449.9\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"242.3\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"207.6\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"High-level rationale (no internal chain-of-thought): 1) The phrase 'up to $50.0 million' is explicit contractual-cap language for a sub-facility (swing line), so per facility-capacity rules ('up to' → maximum) it maps to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. 2–4) The $449.9 million is described as 'outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility' and the $242.3M and $207.6M are its currency-denominated breakdowns; these are amounts of outstanding letters of credit and therefore map to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount (the currency splits are still parts of the outstanding letters amount).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00011\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Summary: The model correctly mapped the phrase 'up to $50.0 million' (a contractual cap on a sub-facility) to LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity, and correctly mapped the $449.9 million described as 'outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees' and its currency breakdowns ($242.3M and $207.6M) to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. The surface cues 'up to' → maximum capacity and 'outstanding letters of credit' → letters-of-credit amount were applied appropriately, producing the same labels as the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"There are no substantive errors — the predicted tags match the ground truth. A minor procedural inconsistency: the model reasoning lists two bullet_ids (ctx-00009, ctx-00011) even though the playbook section states no bullets were used; this does not affect the tagging outcome.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable for a substantive error because the model applied correct mappings. The only potential confusion in similar cases would be misinterpreting 'up to' (which denotes a maximum/limit) as current outstanding or available balance; that did not occur here.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"What the model did is correct: interpret 'up to $X' as a maximum borrowing capacity tag (LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity). Interpret language explicitly stating 'outstanding letters of credit' and its currency-denominated breakdowns as LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount for each disclosed amount (total and component denominations). If a more granular tag existed for currency-specific breakdowns, use it; otherwise reuse LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount for each disclosed figure.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map common disclosure phrasing to tags: 'up to' or 'maximum' → facility maximum/commitment tags; 'outstanding letters of credit' or 'letters of credit outstanding' → LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. When a total is broken down by currency, each numeric component can be tagged with the same concept if no currency-specific tag exists.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
