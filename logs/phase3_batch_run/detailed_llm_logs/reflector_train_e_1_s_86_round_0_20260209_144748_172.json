Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"234.6\" in sentence: \"As of December 31 , 2018 , the Company repurchased approximately $ 234.6 million of the Company 's previously announced $ 275.0 million share repurchase authorization ( which expired at the end of 2018 ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"275.0\" in sentence: \"As of December 31 , 2018 , the Company repurchased approximately $ 234.6 million of the Company 's previously announced $ 275.0 million share repurchase authorization ( which expired at the end of 2018 ) .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"100.0\" in sentence: \"At the Company 's meeting in December 2018 , the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 100.0 million of its common stock which will remain in effect through the end of 2019 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"16.3\" in sentence: \"Under the 2011 Plan , no more than 16.3 million shares of the Company ’ s common stock in aggregate may be issued including shares already issued pursuant to prior awards granted under the 2011 Plan .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) $234.6M: sentence states the Company \\\"repurchased approximately $234.6 million\\\" under a share repurchase authorization. Per unit-driven disambiguation (map currency -> monetary repurchase value) and common tagging for repurchase cash spent, the best-fit tag in the provided taxonomy for the dollar amount representing cash spent to acquire treasury is TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod. 2) $275.0M: described as the \\\"previously announced $275.0 million share repurchase authorization\\\" — this is the authorized program amount. Per equity/plan and repurchase-authorized mapping, the canonical tag is StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1. 3) $100.0M: Board authorized repurchase \\\"up to $100.0 million\\\" — again this is an authorization (program cap), so map to StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1. 4) 16.3 million shares: \\\"no more than 16.3 million shares ... may be issued\\\" under the 2011 Plan — this is a plan-level authorized number of shares; per plan-specific mapping rules, map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized. I applied the playbook rules to (a) distinguish share-count vs currency (assign shares to share-count tag and dollars to monetary/treasury tag) and (b) prefer plan-specific 'authorized shares' tag for plan-authorized share caps and program-authorized amount tag for repurchase authorizations.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00008\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nTreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nStockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's tags to the ground truth and the sentence contexts. The three monetary amounts (234.6, 275.0, 100.0) all relate to a share repurchase program: 234.6 is the amount repurchased under the program, 275.0 is the authorized program amount (the cap) that expired, and 100.0 is a newly authorized cap. The model labeled 275.0 and 100.0 correctly as StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1 but labeled 234.6 as TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod. The model's internal rule mapped any dollar amount related to repurchase activity to a treasury-stock-acquired-cost tag instead of consistently mapping all repurchase-related monetary amounts (both amounts repurchased and authorization caps) to the program-authorization tag used in the ground truth. The phrasing \\\"repurchased approximately $234.6 million of the Company’s previously announced $275.0 million share repurchase authorization\\\" indicates that 234.6 is a program-related monetary disclosure (amount repurchased under the program), not a generic 'treasury stock at cost' accounting balance that would warrant TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod. Therefore the correct tag for 234.6 per the labeling convention is StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1, matching the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the repurchased amount ($234.6M) as TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod instead of StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1. In short, it conflated 'amount repurchased under a program' with 'treasury stock value' and applied the wrong tag for repurchase-related monetary disclosures.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model misunderstood the semantic distinction between (a) disclosures about a share repurchase program (program authorization amounts and amounts repurchased under that program) and (b) accounting measures reflecting the cost basis of treasury stock. It applied a heuristic that mapped monetary repurchase mentions to treasury-stock cost ambiguously, rather than following the dataset convention that repurchase-program monetary amounts (including amounts repurchased) should use the StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1 tag. This error likely arose from an overgeneralized mapping rule and not checking the specific contextual cue 'repurchased ... of the ... share repurchase authorization.'\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Use a context-sensitive tagging rule: if a monetary amount is described as 'repurchased ... of the ... share repurchase authorization' or as an 'authorized' repurchase amount ('authorized to repurchase up to $X' or 'previously announced $X share repurchase authorization'), tag it as StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1. Reserve TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod for explicit statements about the accounting cost basis of treasury stock (e.g., 'treasury stock, at cost' or 'treasury stock acquired at an average cost of $X per share'). Concretely, for the four items: tag 234.6, 275.0, and 100.0 as StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1; tag share-count plan caps (e.g., '16.3 million shares authorized under the plan') with the share-based-compensation-number-of-shares-authorized tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Look at the linguistic frame: phrases linking an amount to a 'share repurchase authorization' (or 'authorized to repurchase up to') indicate a repurchase-program monetary disclosure and should be tagged with StockRepurchaseProgramAuthorizedAmount1. Only use TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod when the disclosure explicitly concerns the accounting cost basis of treasury stock holdings.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
