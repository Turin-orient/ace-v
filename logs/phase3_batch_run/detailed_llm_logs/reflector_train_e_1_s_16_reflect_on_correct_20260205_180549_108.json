Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"84\" in sentence: \"We derived 88 % , 87 % , 84 % and 82 % of revenue through our channel network in the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"46\" in sentence: \"One of our distributors accounted for 46 % , 46 % , 43 % and 42 % of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"46\" in sentence: \"One of our distributors accounted for 46 % , 46 % , 43 % and 42 % of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"43\" in sentence: \"One of our distributors accounted for 46 % , 46 % , 43 % and 42 % of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Identify numeric tokens and their anchors in each sentence. The playbook atomic rule ctx-00013 maps percentages tied to customers/revenues to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 when phrases like 'accounted for % of revenue' or 'of revenue' co-occur with a customer/distributor cue. Step 2 (Q1): \\\"88%, 87%, 84% and 82% of revenue through our channel network\\\" — this links percentages to 'of revenue' and a channel distribution anchor (channel network). Although not an individual customer, this is a revenue-concentration statement (percent of revenue by channel). Per ctx-00013, the best matching tag is ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Step 3 (Q2/Q3/Q4): \\\"One of our distributors accounted for 46%, 46%, 43% and 42% of revenue...\\\" — the phrase 'One of our distributors accounted for X% of revenue' is a direct customer/distributor concentration cue. Per ctx-00013, each percentage is mapped to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Conclusion: for all four requested entities (84, 46, 46, 43) the most appropriate US GAAP tag is ConcentrationRiskPercentage1.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00013\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace: it identified the numeric percentages and their linguistic anchors ('of revenue', 'accounted for', 'through our channel network', 'one of our distributors'). It applied the playbook rule ctx-00013 that maps customer/distributor or revenue-concentration phrases to the tag ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. For Q1 the model correctly treated channel-network percentages as a form of revenue concentration; for Q2–Q4 it correctly treated distributor percentages as customer concentration. The model then returned ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 for all four entities. The environment feedback confirms the predicted tags match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error in the model's reasoning or tagging — the applied rule and final tags are correct and consistent with the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no mistake. If a mistake had occurred, likely causes would be misreading the anchor phrase (e.g., confusing 'of revenue' with a non-revenue percentage) or selecting a tag for a different concept (like pricing or margin) instead of concentration.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should continue to (1) locate percentage values and their nearest semantic anchors, (2) determine whether the anchor indicates revenue concentration (phrases like 'accounted for', 'of revenue', 'one of our distributors', 'channel network'), and (3) map such anchors to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. If context indicated a different concept (interest rate, impairment, allocation), choose the appropriate tag instead.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a percentage is explicitly tied to 'of revenue', 'accounted for', or a named customer/channel/distributor, it denotes revenue concentration and should be tagged as ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Always verify the semantic anchor before selecting a tag to avoid confusing revenue percentages with other percentage-based metrics.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ctx-00013\",\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
