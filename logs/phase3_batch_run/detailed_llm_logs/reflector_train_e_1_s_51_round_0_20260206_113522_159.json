Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"43\" in sentence: \"Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $ 57 million in 2018 , $ 43 million in 2017 and $ 44 million in 2016 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"44\" in sentence: \"Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $ 57 million in 2018 , $ 43 million in 2017 and $ 44 million in 2016 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"243.7\" in sentence: \"Stock Plans Under our Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan ( the “ Plan ” ) , we are authorized through May 21 , 2024 to issue a maximum of 243.7 million shares of our Common Stock to employees and non - employee directors .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"61.1\" in sentence: \"As of December 31 , 2018 , there were 61.1 million shares available to be granted under the Plan .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1 — parse each sentence and locate lexical anchors:\\n- Q1 & Q2 sentence: \\\"Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $57 million in 2018, $43 million in 2017 and $44 million in 2016.\\\" Lexical anchor = \\\"defined contribution plans\\\" + \\\"charged to expense\\\"/\\\"totaled\\\" -> indicates employer contributions expense for defined contribution retirement plans reported on the income statement. Mapping rule: income-statement expense lexical cues + plan type -> map to the specific contributions-by-employer tag for defined contribution plans. Therefore each year-amount (including $43 and $44) should map to DefinedContributionPlanContributionsByEmployer (same tag, with period metadata distinguishing 2017 vs 2016). I checked for any competing tag (e.g., generic InterestExpense or AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense); none apply because the anchor is defined-contribution plan expense.\\n- Q3 sentence: \\\"... we are authorized through May 21, 2024 to issue a maximum of 243.7 million shares of our Common Stock to employees and non-employee directors.\\\" Lexical anchors = \\\"authorized\\\" + \\\"maximum of 243.7 million shares\\\" + explicit plan name. Per plan-authorized rules (plan-anchor + 'authorized'/'maximum' + 'under/the Plan') this maps to the plan-authorized shares taxonomy element: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized.\\n- Q4 sentence: \\\"As of December 31, 2018, there were 61.1 million shares available to be granted under the Plan.\\\" Lexical anchors = \\\"available to be granted under the Plan\\\" -> plan availability mapping. Per plan-availability rules this maps to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant.\\nStep 2 — confirm tag strings match provided taxonomy list: DefinedContributionPlanContributionsByEmployer, ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized, and ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant are present in the supplied tag options.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I re-reviewed the model's trace and the sentences. The two problem items are the 2017 ($43) and 2016 ($44) amounts in the sentence: \\\"Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $57 million in 2018, $43 million in 2017 and $44 million in 2016.\\\" The phrase \\\"charged to expense\\\" is a direct indicator of an expense recognized in profit or loss (i.e., cost recognized), not necessarily the cash contributions made in the period. The model mapped these amounts to a Contributions-by-Employer tag (DefinedContributionPlanContributionsByEmployer) instead of the taxonomy element that captures the expense recognized for defined contribution plans (DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized). The other two answers (authorized shares 243.7 and available to grant 61.1) were correctly mapped to the ShareBasedCompensationArrangement...NumberOfSharesAuthorized and ...NumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant tags. The mistaken mapping occurred because the model semantically equated plan expense with employer contributions and did not verify exact tag availability/names in the provided list.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model selected DefinedContributionPlanContributionsByEmployer for the \\\"charged to expense\\\" amounts instead of the correct tag DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized. In short: it chose a contributions tag rather than a cost/expense-recognition tag.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Two related issues caused the error: (1) conceptual confusion — treating \\\"amounts charged to expense\\\" as equivalent to \\\"contributions by employer\\\" (these can overlap but are distinct disclosures); (2) procedural oversight — the model did not check the exact tag strings available in the provided taxonomy list and relied on an intuitively similar but incorrect tag. The model used semantic similarity rather than exact matching to the taxonomy element that best fits the wording.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Map the lexical cue precisely: \\\"charged to expense\\\" -> an expense/cost-recognized element. Steps the model should have followed: (1) identify the anchor phrase \\\"charged to expense\\\" and classify it as expense recognized in profit or loss; (2) search the available taxonomy list for tags containing 'DefinedContributionPlan' + 'Cost'/'CostRecognized' or synonyms; (3) prefer DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized when the sentence expresses amounts charged to expense; (4) reserve DefinedContributionPlanContributionsByEmployer for sentences that explicitly mention employer contributions paid or cash contributed. Always verify the exact tag string exists in the provided options before selecting.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a sentence says an amount was \\\"charged to expense\\\" or \\\"recognized as cost/expense,\\\" select a CostRecognized/Cost tag, not a ContributionsByEmployer tag.
