Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of research and development tax credits , offset by additional income tax expense due to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the lowering of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % under H . R . 1 , informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which was enacted into law on December 22 , 2017 ( the Tax Reform ) .?\"\n2.

R . 1 , informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which was enacted into law on December 22 , 2017 ( the Tax Reform ) .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"Among other matters , the Tax Reform lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1 , 2018 , and transitioned U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"21\" in sentence: \"Among other matters , the Tax Reform lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1 , 2018 , and transitioned U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1 — Identify numeric tokens and lexical anchors: the sentences contain percentages '35%' and '21%' and explicitly refer to 'the corporate federal income tax rate' and 'the U.S. statutory rate'. The lexical cue 'tax rate'/'statutory rate' is the measurement-term governing these percentages. Step 2 — Choose appropriate US GAAP tag: percentages that express the federal statutory tax rate used in the effective tax rate reconciliation should map to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. This tag exactly captures the statutory federal tax-rate reference (both the prior 35% and the new 21%). Step 3 — Apply consistently to all four items: in each question the numeric is the federal statutory tax rate (either the old 35% or new 21%), so each maps to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. Error checks / mistakes avoided: I did not map these to overall effective tax rate (EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations) or to some generic percentage tag; I used the measurement-term precedence (map numeric to the measurement noun in the clause: 'corporate federal income tax rate'). Final mapping: all four entities map to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00002\", \"ctx-00011\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly parsed the sentences, identified the numeric tokens 35% and 21% and the lexical anchor 'corporate federal income tax rate' (and the related phrase 'U.S. statutory rate'). It then selected the US GAAP tag that specifically corresponds to the federal statutory income tax rate used in an effective tax rate reconciliation: EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. The mapping was applied consistently to each of the four questions because each numeric value serves the same semantic role (the federal statutory tax rate), so the same tag is appropriate for all four items.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mapping was correct and matches the ground truth. The chosen tag precisely captures the concept expressed by the numeric percentages in context.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable: there was no mistaken concept or calculation.
