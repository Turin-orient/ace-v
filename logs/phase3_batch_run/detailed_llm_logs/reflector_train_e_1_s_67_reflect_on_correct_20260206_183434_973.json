Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I inspected each sentence and matched the semantic phrase to the most specific US GAAP tag available. For Q1 the phrase \\\"investments in unconsolidated equity affiliates of $190,964\\\" clearly describes investments accounted for under the equity method, so EquityMethodInvestments is the correct tag. For Q2–Q4 the numbers (10, 30, 3) are stated as useful lives for classes of PP&E (buildings; buildings range; furniture, fixtures and equipment), so PropertyPlantAndEquipmentUsefulLife is the appropriate tag for each. I verified the model output exactly matched these mappings and the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error: the model's mappings were correct and matched the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no incorrect reasoning or misclassification in this instance. The model used straightforward lexical and semantic cues correctly.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The approach used is appropriate: identify the accounting concept from the phrase (equity-method investments vs. useful lives of PP&E) and map to the most specific available US GAAP tag. Continue to prefer the most specific tag that directly describes the described item.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map descriptive phrases (e.g., 'investments in unconsolidated equity affiliates', 'useful lives') to the most specific US GAAP concept tags rather than to generic numeric or monetary tags.
