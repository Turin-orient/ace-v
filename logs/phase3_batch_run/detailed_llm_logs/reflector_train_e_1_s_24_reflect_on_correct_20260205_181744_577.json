Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"93\" in sentence: \"The total fair value of shares vested was $ 93 million in 2018 , $ 76 million in 2017 , and $ 57 million in 2016 . Deferred Compensation and Other Restricted Stock Awards Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain employees and directors .?\"\n2.

What is best tag for entity \"20.77\" in sentence: \"The weighted - average grant - date fair value of awards granted was $ 20.77 during 2018 , $ 18.55 during 2017 , and $ 11.46 during 2016 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I located share-based compensation phrases and applied the playbook share-compensation heuristics.

The phrase \\\"weighted-average grant-date fair value ... $20.77\\\" is an explicit weighted-average grant-date fair value per share (per-share), so per ctx-00010 this maps to the GrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue tag for equity awards other than options.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the sentence-level cues and mapping rules. The phrases \\\"total fair value of shares vested was $93 million / $76 million / $57 million\\\" explicitly describe aggregate dollar amounts for shares that vested in the period (a summed fair-value amount for vested awards). This phrase matches the ShareBasedCompensation...VestedInPeriodTotalFairValue tag, which represents total fair value of equity awards vested in the period. The separate sentence \\\"The weighted-average grant-date fair value of awards granted was $20.77 during 2018...\\\" uses the lexical phrase \\\"weighted-average grant-date fair value,\\\" indicating a per-award (per-share or per-award) weighted-average grant-date fair value measure; this maps to ShareBasedCompensation...GrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue. I confirmed units and modifiers: amounts given as millions of dollars indicate totals, while the explicit \\\"weighted-average\\\" phrase indicates an average per unit measure. The model applied these heuristics and selected the most specific share-based-compensation tags accordingly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings and final answers match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because the reasoning and tag selection were correct; there was no conceptual mistake or calculation error.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same approach: (1) identify lexical cues (e.g., \\\"vested\\\", \\\"total fair value\\\", \\\"weighted-average grant-date fair value\\\"); (2) determine whether the value is an aggregate dollar amount versus a per-unit weighted-average; (3) select the most specific share-based-compensation tag that matches the phrase and units.
