Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"38.7\" in sentence: \"( 2 ) Includes of $ 12.2 million , of $ 21.8 million , and restructuring expense of $ 38.7 million .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"135.2\" in sentence: \"( 3 ) Includes of $ 18.5 million , and of $ 135.2 million .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"20\" in sentence: \"The Company generally accounts for entities using the equity method when it holds a greater than 20 % but less than 50 % voting interest or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"50\" in sentence: \"The Company generally accounts for entities using the equity method when it holds a greater than 20 % but less than 50 % voting interest or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Summary of determinations (concise, non-sensitive): 1) The phrase explicitly contains 'restructuring expense of $38.7 million' — lexical match to the restructuring expense tag -> RestructuringCharges. 2) The snippet provides no explicit lexical cue for the $135.2 million amount; absent a clear label, the best generic fit for a large charge in footnote groupings is an impairment-related tag -> AssetImpairmentCharges. 3) & 4) The sentence refers to ownership percentage thresholds for applying the equity method ('greater than 20% but less than 50% voting interest'), so both numeric values represent ownership percentages -> EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage for 20 and for 50.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\", \"misc-00002\", \"ctx-00013\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"RestructuringCharges,AssetImpairmentCharges,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nRestructuringCharges,AssetImpairmentCharges,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nRestructuringCharges,GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage,EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each of the four predicted tag mappings and compared them to the ground truth. Q1: The model mapped 'restructuring expense of $38.7 million' to RestructuringCharges — that is correct and based on an exact lexical match to the accounting concept. Q3 and Q4: The model mapped the numeric thresholds '20' and '50' in the equity-method sentence to EquityMethodInvestmentOwnershipPercentage — also correct because the sentence explicitly describes ownership percentage thresholds for equity-method accounting. Q2: The model saw '(3) Includes of $18.5 million, and of $135.2 million.' and, lacking a lexical cue, defaulted to a generic large-charge tag (AssetImpairmentCharges). The ground truth is GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt. The model failed to use section structure and typical footnote patterns: parenthetical numbered items like “(3) Includes …” commonly enumerate components of a single line item (for example, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt), and the absence of wording like 'impairment' argues against AssetImpairmentCharges. In short, the model relied on an inappropriate heuristic (large, unlabeled amount => impairment) instead of using document/section cues and a shortlist of plausible financial event tags such as extinguishment of debt vs impairment.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The specific mistake was selecting AssetImpairmentCharges for the $135.2 amount. The model used a magnitude-based fallback instead of identifying the correct transaction category (GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt) that the footnote was enumerating.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The error arose from two related misunderstandings: (1) an over-reliance on a weak heuristic (large unlabeled monetary amount implies an impairment) rather than looking for structural and lexical context, and (2) failure to map the parenthetical-numbered footnote format to common accounting components. The model did not check whether common keywords for impairment ('impair', 'write-down', 'impairment') were present and did not consider that many notes list components of debt-related gains/losses without repeating the word 'debt' adjacent to each amount.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When an amount lacks a local lexical cue, the model should (a) consult the surrounding sentence/heading and the numbered-footnote structure to infer which line item the parenthetical enumerates, (b) prefer tags that match typical footnote component sets (e.g., extinguishment gains/losses, restructuring, acquisition costs) over generic large-charge labels, and (c) use keyword absence as negative evidence (if 'impair' or 'impairment' is not present, do not select an impairment tag). Concretely for Q2, the model should have recognized that '(3) Includes ... and of $135.2' is listing components of a prior labeled aggregate (likely extinguishment of debt) and chosen GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt instead of AssetImpairmentCharges.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Prioritize explicit lexical matches and document structure (headings, numbered footnote components) over heuristics based on amount size. When local labels are missing, use typical accounting-note patterns to narrow candidate tags and rule out tags whose keywords are absent.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
