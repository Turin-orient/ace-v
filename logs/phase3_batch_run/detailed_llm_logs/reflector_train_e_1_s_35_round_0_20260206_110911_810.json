Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and each question-answer mapping. Questions 1–3 were correctly mapped: Q1 asks for a vesting period (\\\"one year\\\"), which correctly maps to the AwardVestingPeriod element; Q2 and Q3 report counts of \\\"dividend equivalent units outstanding\\\" at specific reporting dates (33 thousand and 28 thousand), which correctly map to the NonvestedNumber element for equity instruments other than options. The sole error is Q4: the model mapped \\\"8 thousand unit appreciation rights issued\\\" to the options grants-in-period (OptionsGrantsInPeriodGross) tag. The ground truth instead uses the equity-instruments-other-than-options grants-in-period tag. Therefore the mistake is a misclassification of the instrument class (unit appreciation rights) and selection of the wrong tag variant (options + gross). The rest of the mapping logic and number extraction were correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified \\\"unit appreciation rights\\\" as an option-type award and selected 'OptionsGrantsInPeriodGross' instead of the correct 'EquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod'. It also chose a 'Gross' variant tied to the options tag rather than the correct equity-instruments-other-than-options grants-in-period element.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a conceptual mapping error: the model conflated 'unit appreciation rights' with standard stock options. While both are share-based awards, unit appreciation rights (SARs/UARs) are typically treated as equity instruments other than options (or require a different tag) in the taxonomy list provided. The model applied a superficial keyword match to 'grants'/'issued' and selected an options-related tag instead of matching the instrument type phrase ('unit appreciation rights') to the appropriate non-option equity tag.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should (a) identify the instrument type precisely from the phrase 'unit appreciation rights' and consult a mapping that distinguishes 'options' from 'equity instruments other than options' (e.g., RSUs, SARs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent units), and (b) choose the grants-in-period tag for that instrument class. Concretely, map 'unit appreciation rights' -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod (not the options tag or the 'Gross' variant). Also verify whether the sentence uses 'issued'/'granted' during the period to pick the 'GrantsInPeriod' element.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Never assume 'grants' or 'options' are interchangeable. First classify the award type from the instrument phrase (options vs equity-instruments-other-than-options), then select the corresponding taxonomy element. Maintain a small keyword-to-tag mapping: e.g., 'option' -> OptionsGrantsInPeriod..., 'restricted stock'/'RSU'/'unit appreciation rights'/'dividend equivalent units' -> EquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod/NonvestedNumber, and check 'Gross' variants only when the taxonomy and context require them.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
