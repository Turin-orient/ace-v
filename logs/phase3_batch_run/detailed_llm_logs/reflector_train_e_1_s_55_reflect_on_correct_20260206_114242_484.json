Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"0.7\" in sentence: \"Certain debt retirements occurred prior to the stated maturity dates and resulted in losses totaling $ 0.7 million in 2016 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"three\" in sentence: \"These notes have maturities ranging up to three years , are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate , and have no recourse to any other assets .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"These notes have maturities ranging up to three years , are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate , and have no recourse to any other assets .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"7.57\" in sentence: \"The stated interest rates on these notes range up to 7.57 % .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: The sentence describes debt retirements prior to maturity that resulted in losses of $0.7 million. That is a loss on extinguishment of debt (debt retirement loss). The playbook's footnote-component / acquisition/extinguishment mapping explicitly lists GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt for such amounts, so map $0.7M -> GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt.\\n\\nQ2: The phrase 'maturities ranging up to three years' provides the numeric cardinal 'three' as the term/length of the debt instrument. The appropriate element for an instrument term (duration) is DebtInstrumentTerm. Thus the numeral 'three' maps to DebtInstrumentTerm (the term value).\\n\\nQ3: The token 'years' is the time unit accompanying the maturity measure; per the temporal-expression rules (map numeric+governing noun to the instrument term/expiration tag), the unit and the numeric jointly describe the DebtInstrumentTerm. Therefore map 'years' to DebtInstrumentTerm as the duration/term qualifier.\\n\\nQ4: '7.57%' is a stated interest rate on the notes. The percent attached to a debt instrument should be mapped to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage per the percent+instrument-anchor heuristic in the playbook. So 7.57 -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.\\n\\nAll mappings follow the playbook heuristics: footnote/aggregate component mapping for extinguishment losses, temporal-expression/term mapping for maturities, and percent+instrument mapping for stated interest rates. No alternative tags (maturity date, fair value, spread) fit the literal phrasing (no specific date, no LIBOR/spread language, percent explicitly refers to stated interest), so chosen tags are the most specific matches.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00010\",\n    \"ctx-00029\",\n    \"ctx-00012\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nGainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nGainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentTerm,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each of the four extractions and the model's mapping decisions. Q1: The phrase describes losses from early debt retirements of $0.7 million. The most specific US GAAP tag for an amount representing gains or losses on debt extinguishment is GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt, so mapping is correct. Q2: \\\"three\\\" is the numeric length of maturities. The appropriate tag for an instrument's term/duration is DebtInstrumentTerm, so mapping is correct. Q3: \\\"years\\\" is the time unit that, together with the numeric, defines the debt term. The term tag (DebtInstrumentTerm) is the right target for the maturity expression; mapping is correct. Q4: \\\"7.57%\\\" is an explicitly stated interest rate; the proper tag for a stated rate on a debt instrument is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, so mapping is correct. The model applied straightforward heuristics: monetary loss on early extinguishment → GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt; numeric+unit describing maturity → DebtInstrumentTerm; percent expressing stated interest → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. The predicted answers exactly match the ground truth, so no correction was required.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No errors were made. The model's tag assignments are correct and align with the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there is no mistaken concept or calculation in the model's reasoning. The model correctly recognized the semantic roles of the numeric and monetary expressions and selected the most specific US GAAP tags.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the same specific-mapping strategy: (1) Map monetary amounts describing losses on debt extinguishment to GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt; (2) Map numeric maturity values and their units (e.g., \\\"three years\\\") to DebtInstrumentTerm rather than splitting the numeric and unit into separate, less-appropriate tags; (3) Map explicit interest-rate percentages to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. When ambiguous, prefer the most specific tag that directly corresponds to the described attribute (loss on extinguishment, instrument term, stated interest rate).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Match the semantic role of the value to the most specific instrument-level tag: monetary losses tied to debt retirement → GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt; numeric+unit maturity expressions → DebtInstrumentTerm; a percent that describes the stated coupon/interest → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Avoid mapping the unit alone when the schema expects a combined term value.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
