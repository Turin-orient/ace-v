Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"184,964\" in sentence: \"Interest charges associated with the term loans totaled $ 184,964 and $ 343,028 for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2017 , respectively .?\"\n2.

The three- and nine-month amounts for 2017 ($184,964 and $343,028) and for 2016 ($19,016 and $39,516) are all interest charges related to the term loans, so each numeric is assigned InterestExpenseDebt.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00012\",\n    \"err-00004\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nInterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nInterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt,InterestExpenseDebt\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model detected the phrase 'Interest charges' and the instrument anchor 'term loans' in each sentence. Under common XBRL mapping rules, a numeric amount described as interest associated with a specific debt instrument should be mapped to an interest-expense tag that is instrument-specific. The model applied the playbook rule (ctx-00012) and the anti-pattern guidance (err-00004) to choose InterestExpenseDebt for each reported amount. Each of the four numbers is an interest charge for the term loans for the stated periods, so mapping all four to InterestExpenseDebt is consistent and correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and final tag assignments are correct and match the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistake.
