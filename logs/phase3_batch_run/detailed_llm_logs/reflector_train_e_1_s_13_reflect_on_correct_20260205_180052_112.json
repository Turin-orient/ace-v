Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Total sales to the distributor Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates ( “ Tech Data ” ) accounted for 32 % and 31 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the three months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , and 31 % and 30 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the nine months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Total sales to the distributor Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates ( “ Tech Data ” ) accounted for 32 % and 31 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the three months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , and 31 % and 30 % of Autodesk ’ s total net revenue for the nine months ended October 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"28\" in sentence: \"In addition , Tech Data accounted for 28 % and 20 % of trade accounts receivable at October 31 , 2017 and January 31 , 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"20\" in sentence: \"In addition , Tech Data accounted for 28 % and 20 % of trade accounts receivable at October 31 , 2017 and January 31 , 2017 , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Identify numeric tokens and anchors. The sentences contain percentage amounts (32%, 31%, 31%, 30%; 28%, 20%) tied to a named customer/distributor 'Tech Data'. Step 2: Select mapping heuristic. Playbook ctx-00013 (Customer-concentration percentage mapping) prescribes mapping percentages that quantify customer concentration of revenues to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 when the percent is within the capture window of customer/revenue cues. Step 3: Apply to questions 1–2. The 31% values are explicitly ‘‘of Autodesk’s total net revenue’’ and occur with the customer anchor 'Tech Data' in the same sentence, so map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Step 4: Apply to questions 3–4. The 28% and 20% are ‘‘of trade accounts receivable’’ and explicitly state Tech Data’s share of receivables — still a customer concentration metric (concentration of receivables). No more specific receivables-concentration tag exists in the provided taxonomy, so the best-match remains ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. Step 5: Check for conflicts. No competing measurement-term or instrument cues are present; the customer + ‘of [revenue/receivable]’ patterns directly match the concentration heuristic. Conclusion: all four asked entities map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1. No prior mistakes to diagnose in this reasoning (playbook reflection empty).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00013\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1,ConcentrationRiskPercentage1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model identified numeric percentages tied to a named customer (Tech Data) and recognized these as customer-concentration metrics. For the first two items the text explicitly says ‘of Autodesk’s total net revenue’, and for the latter two it says ‘of trade accounts receivable’. The taxonomy contains a ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 tag appropriate for customer concentration percentages. No more specific tag for receivable-concentration was present in the provided list, so mapping all four percentages to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 is a correct, consistent choice. The model therefore matched the context (customer anchor + ‘of [measure]’) to the concentration tag and returned the same tag for all four items.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error: the predicted tags match the ground truth exactly. The reasoning and final mapping were correct for each item.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no mistake. A possible source of future error would be failing to check whether a more specific tag (e.g., revenue-specific or receivable-specific concentration) exists in the taxonomy, but in this instance no such tag was available.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) locate the numeric percentage and its anchor (customer/entity), (2) read the measurement context (‘of revenue’, ‘of receivables’, etc.), (3) search the taxonomy for the best-fitting concentration tag, and (4) choose ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 when the taxonomy lacks a more specific receivable- or revenue-concentration tag. Ensure you verify there is no more specific tag before defaulting to the general concentration tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a percentage quantifies a single customer’s share of revenue or receivables, map it to the concentration-percentage tag in the taxonomy; always prioritize an explicit measurement context and check for more specific tags first.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
