Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"546,440\" in sentence: \"Lastly , the Company issued three notes totaling $ 546,440 , which represented the remaining outstanding debt of CRA that was not included as part of the sale of U.S. Operations at March 31 , 2016 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"2,254,500\" in sentence: \"India Office Building Mortgage In May 2014 , My Mobile Payments Limited obtained a $ 2,254,500 loan with Union Bank of India to purchase an office building to be used as its headquarters .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"16\" in sentence: \"The loan was interest only for the first six months at the rate of 16 % per annum .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"15\" in sentence: \"Thereafter , the interest rate is 15 % per annum , and principal and interest payments are to be made in 26 equal quarterly payments .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric to the most specific debt-related tags using the playbook heuristics. Key rules applied: (1) unit-and-anchor validation (ctx-00010) — currency amounts near instrument anchors (note, loan) map to debt face/ principal tags; (2) instrument/issuance detection (ctx-00005, ph-00006, misc-00002) — phrases like \\\"issued three notes totaling $546,440\\\" and \\\"obtained a $2,254,500 loan\\\" indicate the principal/face amount of debt instruments, so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is the appropriate tag rather than carrying value or fair value; (3) interest-rate 'per annum' mapping (ctx-00011) — percentage tokens with 'per annum' and an instrument-anchor (loan) deterministically map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage and take precedence over spread or generic percentage tags. Applying these: Q1: $546,440 = DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (issued notes total); Q2: $2,254,500 = DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (loan principal obtained); Q3: 16% per annum = DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (explicit 'per annum' + loan anchor); Q4: 15% per annum = DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (same reasoning). I avoided common mistakes: did not conflate 'issued' amount with consideration/purchase-price tags (err-00003) and prioritized instrument-specific interest-rate mapping over generic percentage or spread tags (err-00014 / ctx-00011).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00010\",\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"misc-00002\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLongTermDebt,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model applied an instrument-level heuristic: amounts near words like \\\"issued\\\" or \\\"loan\\\" map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount; percentages with 'per annum' map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. For Q2 (\\\"obtained a $2,254,500 loan\\\") the instrument-level mapping to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is appropriate. For Q3 and Q4 the interest-rate mapping is correct. The single misclassification is Q1: the model tagged $546,440 as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount but the ground truth is LongTermDebt. The sentence: \\\"issued three notes totaling $546,440, which represented the remaining outstanding debt of CRA that was not included as part of the sale of U.S. Operations at March 31, 2016\\\" contains signals that this is a balance-sheet presentation (\\\"remaining outstanding debt\\\", \\\"at March 31, 2016\\\") describing a liability amount as of a reporting date — i.e., LongTermDebt — not merely the face amount of an individual instrument. The model prioritized the presence of the word 'issued' and 'notes' over the contextual cues indicating a period-end outstanding liability, leading to the wrong tag for Q1.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The error was misclassifying an amount that describes a period-end outstanding liability as an instrument-level 'face amount'. The model over-applied the 'instrument issuance -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount' heuristic and failed to use contextual cues like 'remaining outstanding debt' and 'at March 31, 2016' that indicate a balance-sheet category (LongTermDebt).\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual confusion between 'instrument-level' and 'account-level' tags. The model's heuristic treated any currency amount linked to words such as 'issued', 'notes', or 'loan' as a DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. It did not distinguish when the narrative is describing an outstanding liability at a reporting date (account-level, e.g., LongTermDebt) versus describing the original issuance/principal of a specific instrument (instrument-level face amount). This is a rule-application error (overgeneralization) rather than a numeric or parsing mistake.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1) Add a decision step: check whether the numeric amount is tied to a reporting date or described as 'outstanding', 'remaining', 'at [date]', 'as of' or presented as part of the sale/closing context. If yes, prefer balance-sheet account tags (LongTermDebt or CurrentPortionOfLongTermDebt etc.). 2) If the amount is described as an origination/obtained/issued amount in an issuance event without period-end phrasing, prefer instrument-level tags such as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. 3) For interest rates, continue to use DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage when 'per annum' or explicit stated rate is present. Applying these: Q1 should be LongTermDebt because the text frames $546,440 as the remaining outstanding debt at March 31, 2016; Q2 remains DebtInstrumentFaceAmount; Q3 and Q4 remain DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish 'instrument-level' (face amount, issue terms) vs 'account-level' (balance-sheet liabilities) by looking for temporal/positional cues: words like 'outstanding', 'remaining', 'as of', 'at [date]' indicate balance-sheet amounts (LongTermDebt), while words like 'obtained', 'issued' with transaction timing and absence of period-end language indicate instrument face amounts.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00005\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ph-00006\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"misc-00002\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}",
