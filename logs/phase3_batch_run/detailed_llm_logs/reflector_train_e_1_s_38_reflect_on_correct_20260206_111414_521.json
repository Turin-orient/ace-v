Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"1,696\" in sentence: \"The Company recognized $ 1,696 of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired from Archway and Huntington Steele during the six months ended June 30 , 2018 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"619\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs were $ 619 and $ 1,201 during the three and six months ended June 30 , 2018 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"1,201\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs were $ 619 and $ 1,201 during the three and six months ended June 30 , 2018 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"four\" in sentence: \"Its four primary business lines include : natural gas services , including liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage ; terminalling and storage services for petroleum products and by - products including the refining of naphthenic crude oil , blending and packaging of finished lubricants ; sulfur and sulfur - based products processing , manufacturing , marketing and distribution ; and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by - products .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric/entity to the most specific US GAAP tag by matching the described nature of the expense/number in each sentence to the taxonomy: \\n1) \\\"$1,696 of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired from Archway and Huntington Steele...\\\" — the phrase explicitly ties the amount to amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions, so the best tag is AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets (direct match to amortization of intangible assets). \\n2) \\\"Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs were $619...\\\" — this ties amortization to deferred contract costs (i.e., capitalized contract costs). The specific taxonomy element for amortization of such contract costs is CapitalizedContractCostAmortization. \\n3) Same sentence, the six‑months amount $1,201 is the same conceptual measure (amortization of deferred contract/capitalized contract costs for the six-month period) so it is also CapitalizedContractCostAmortization. \\n4) \\\"Its four primary business lines include: ...\\\" — the sentence states the count of primary business lines; this corresponds to the entity’s number of operating segments. The appropriate tag is NumberOfOperatingSegments (preferred over reportable-segments because the wording is \\\"primary business lines\\\"/operating lines). \\nI verified each mapping by matching the lexical anchors (\\\"amortization\\\" + \\\"intangible assets acquired\\\"; \\\"amortization\\\" + \\\"deferred contract costs\\\"; and \\\"primary business lines\\\") to the most specific taxonomy element available, avoiding generic fallbacks.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"misc-00002\",\"ctx-00006\",\"ctx-00001\",\"ctx-00010\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,NumberOfOperatingSegments\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,NumberOfOperatingSegments\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,CapitalizedContractCostAmortization,NumberOfOperatingSegments\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each sentence and looked for lexical anchors that indicate the accounting concept being measured, then matched those concepts to the most specific US GAAP tag available. For Q1 the phrase \\\"$1,696 of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired\\\" directly signals amortization of intangible assets → AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. For Q2 and Q3 the phrase \\\"Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs\\\" signals amortization of capitalized contract costs (deferred contract costs are capitalized contract costs) → CapitalizedContractCostAmortization for both the three- and six-month amounts. For Q4 the phrase \\\"Its four primary business lines include...\\\" states a count of the entity's business lines (i.e., operating segments) → NumberOfOperatingSegments. I verified that each mapping selects the most specific tag that directly corresponds to the described measure, and that the tags apply equally to the three- and six-month amounts (same concept, different periods).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings and final answer match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because the reasoning and tag selection were correct.
