Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"93\" in sentence: \"The total fair value of shares vested was $ 93 million in 2018 , $ 76 million in 2017 , and $ 57 million in 2016 . Deferred Compensation and Other Restricted Stock Awards Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain employees and directors .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"76\" in sentence: \"The total fair value of shares vested was $ 93 million in 2018 , $ 76 million in 2017 , and $ 57 million in 2016 . Deferred Compensation and Other Restricted Stock Awards Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain employees and directors .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"57\" in sentence: \"The total fair value of shares vested was $ 93 million in 2018 , $ 76 million in 2017 , and $ 57 million in 2016 . Deferred Compensation and Other Restricted Stock Awards Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain employees and directors .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"20.77\" in sentence: \"The weighted - average grant - date fair value of awards granted was $ 20.77 during 2018 , $ 18.55 during 2017 , and $ 11.46 during 2016 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I matched the phrases to share-based compensation tags in the playbook. The sentence 'The total fair value of shares vested was $93 million ... $76 million ... $57 million' explicitly reports the total fair value of shares that vested during the period. Per ctx-00006 (share-based compensation mapping) and ctx-00001 lexical rules, this maps deterministically to the vested-in-period total fair value tag for equity awards (here the surrounding text references restricted stock / Common Shares—i.e., equity instruments other than options). Therefore all three currency amounts (93, 76, 57) use ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue. The weighted-average grant-date fair value numbers (20.77, 18.55, 11.46) are grant-date fair value per award; per ctx-00012 (grant-date fair value per share) and ctx-00006 precedence (and given the context referencing restricted stock/common shares), the appropriate tag is the weighted-average grant-date fair value for equity instruments other than options: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue. I validated unit/anchor consistency (currency amounts with 'fair value' / 'weighted-average grant-date fair value') per ctx-00010 unit-and-anchor validation.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00006\", \"ctx-00012\", \"ctx-00001\", \"ctx-00010\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read the sentences and matched the numeric amounts to specific share-based compensation disclosures. The phrase 'total fair value of shares vested was $93 million in 2018, $76 million in 2017, and $57 million in 2016' explicitly reports the aggregate fair value of equity awards that vested during each period; the surrounding text references Common Shares/restricted stock (equity instruments other than options). That maps directly to the tag for vested-in-period total fair value for equity awards: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue. The second sentence 'The weighted-average grant-date fair value of awards granted was $20.77 during 2018, $18.55 during 2017, and $11.46 during 2016' clearly refers to the weighted-average grant-date fair value per award for equity awards, which maps to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue. I checked that the instrument type (common shares / restricted stock) implies the 'EquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptions' family and validated unit/context consistency (currency amounts and the phrase 'fair value' / 'grant-date fair value'). The predicted tags match these mappings and the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and tag assignments are correct and match the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistake.
