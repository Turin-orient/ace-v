Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"20,000\" in sentence: \"As of June 30 , 2018 , the Company has designated 200,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock and 20,000 shares as Series D Preferred Stock .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"810,000\" in sentence: \"On August 21 , 2017 , the Company designated 810,000 shares as Series C Preferred Stock and issued 180,000 shares .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"800,000\" in sentence: \"On August 21 , 2017 , the Company designated 800,000 shares as Series B Preferred Stock and issued 800,000 shares .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"300,000,000\" in sentence: \"Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of $ 0.001 par value common stock , and has 28,026,713 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30 , 2018 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Apply equity lexical rules: the verb 'designated' in context of a class/series of preferred stock indicates the number of shares authorized for that series (not shares issued or outstanding). The playbook equity rules map series-designation/authorized counts to PreferredStockSharesAuthorized. Thus: (1) '20,000' designated as Series D Preferred Stock -> PreferredStockSharesAuthorized. (2) '810,000' designated as Series C Preferred Stock -> PreferredStockSharesAuthorized (the sentence separately notes 180,000 were issued, but 810,000 is the authorized/designated amount). (3) '800,000' designated as Series B Preferred Stock -> PreferredStockSharesAuthorized (even though issued equals designated, the phrasing 'designated' anchors it to authorized shares). (4) In the common-stock sentence, 'authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares' is the canonical authorized-common-shares value -> CommonStockSharesAuthorized. Selections are taken from the provided US GAAP tag list and follow the playbook rule that 'designated'/'authorized' map to *SharesAuthorized tags and 'shares outstanding' maps to SharesOutstanding (not requested here).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00001\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nPreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nPreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I verified each sentence phrase-by-phrase and mapped the numeric entity to the US GAAP tag that represents the number of shares authorized/designated for a series or class. For 1–3 the verb 'designated' indicates the company allocated/authorized that many shares to each preferred series (not necessarily issued or outstanding), so the correct tag is PreferredStockSharesAuthorized for each. For 4 the phrase 'authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares' is the canonical wording for common stock authorization, so the correct tag is CommonStockSharesAuthorized. The model selected those four tags accordingly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error — the model applied the correct lexical mapping rules and produced the same answers as the ground truth. There were no calculation mistakes or misapplied strategies in this instance.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable here because the reasoning and tag assignments were correct. A potential source of error in similar tasks would be confusing 'designated'/'authorized' with 'issued' or 'outstanding', but that confusion did not occur here.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using explicit lexical cues: map 'designated' and 'authorized' to *SharesAuthorized tags; map 'issued' to tags that represent shares issued (e.g., StockIssuedDuringPeriodShares or SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction when context fits); map 'outstanding' to CommonStockSharesOutstanding. If multiple share counts appear in a sentence, carefully associate each numeric value with its governing verb/phrase before tagging.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Key mapping rule to remember: 'designated' or 'authorized' → SharesAuthorized tag for that security class; 'issued' → shares issued tag; 'outstanding' → shares outstanding tag. Always anchor the numeric entity to the nearest controlling verb or noun phrase.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
