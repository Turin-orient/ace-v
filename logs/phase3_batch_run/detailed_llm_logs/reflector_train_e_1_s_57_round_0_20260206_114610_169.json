Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"118\" in sentence: \"For the years ended December 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , rent expense for operating leases was $ 118 million , $ 84 million and $ 74 million , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"84\" in sentence: \"For the years ended December 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , rent expense for operating leases was $ 118 million , $ 84 million and $ 74 million , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"74\" in sentence: \"For the years ended December 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , rent expense for operating leases was $ 118 million , $ 84 million and $ 74 million , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"8\" in sentence: \"To the extent that any of the reserved shares , cash , and convertible notes remain undistributed upon resolution of the remaining disputed claims , such amounts will be returned to CEC . As of December 31 , 2018 , approximately $ 49 million in cash , 8 million shares of CEC common stock , and $ 32 million in principal value of CEC Convertible Notes remain in reserve for distribution to holders of disputed claims whose claims may ultimately become allowed in the escrow trust .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Identify the phrase: 'rent expense for operating leases was $118 million ...' The lexical cue 'rent expense' + 'operating leases' explicitly indicates an operating-lease expense line. From the playbook, lease-related monetary amounts expressed as operating lease rent/expense should map to the operating-lease expense element (do not apply the event-driven override for closure/impairment because no closure/impairment language is present). Therefore $118M -> OperatingLeaseExpense. 2) Same sentence, $84M is the 2017 value of the same 'rent expense for operating leases' line; map identically to OperatingLeaseExpense (preserve period metadata separately). 3) Same logic for $74M (2016) -> OperatingLeaseExpense. 4) Sentence: '...approximately $49 million in cash, 8 million shares of CEC common stock, and $32 million in principal value of CEC Convertible Notes remain in reserve for distribution ... in the escrow trust.' The numeric '8 million shares of CEC common stock' describes shares held in reserve for distribution (corporate common stock reserved for future issuance/distribution), not an issuance/underwriter/plan grant. Per equity-reserved rules, when shares are described as reserved for issuance/distribution under charter/escrow (corporate reserved shares) map to CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance. Therefore the 8M shares -> CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance. (No plan/award wording present that would suggest plan-authorized or SBC tags.)\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00027\", \"ctx-00001\", \"ctx-00022\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"OperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nOperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nOperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet,OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet,OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet,CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly identified that the three monetary amounts ($118M, $84M, $74M) describe rent expense for operating leases and that the 8 million shares are reserved common shares in escrow. However, when mapping the rent amounts it selected the tag OperatingLeaseExpense rather than the specific OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet tag present in the provided US GAAP tag list. The model's internal mapping used a plausible but different tag name instead of matching the exact, more specific tag in the list. The rest of the mapping (shares -> CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance) was correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model chose OperatingLeaseExpense instead of the ground-truth tag OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet for the rent amounts. This is a tag-selection mismatch (incorrect tag choice), not a misunderstanding of the underlying accounting fact.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a tag-selection error caused by (a) relying on a generic or intuitive tag name rather than verifying the precise tag strings available in the taxonomy list, and (b) insufficient prioritization of exact lexical matches or most-specific tags when multiple similarly named tags exist. The model treated a semantically equivalent but differently named tag as acceptable, but the evaluation requires the exact taxonomy tag.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When mapping textual facts to taxonomy tags, the model should: 1) search the provided tag list for exact lexical matches or the most specific tag that captures the phrase; 2) prefer an explicitly matching tag (e.g., look for 'rent' + 'operating lease' and select OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet); 3) if multiple candidate tags exist, choose the one whose name most closely mirrors the phrasing in the sentence and the taxonomy domain (net rent expense for operating leases here); 4) apply the chosen tag consistently across period values. Concretely, the model should have matched the phrase 'rent expense for operating leases' to OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet rather than OperatingLeaseExpense.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always prioritize exact or most-specific tag names from the provided taxonomy when mapping text to tags. Match key lexical cues (e.g., 'rent' and 'operating leases') to the tag list before falling back to generic labels.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
