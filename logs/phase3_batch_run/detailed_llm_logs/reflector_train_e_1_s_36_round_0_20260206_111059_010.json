Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

What is best tag for entity \"3,800,000\" in sentence: \"A total of 3,800,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: The phrase 'still available for grant' with an explicit Plan anchor ('Stock Plans') matches the playbook plan-availability rule (ctx-00001). Therefore map 13,468,557 -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant.\\n\\nQ2: 'granted 1,902,592 RSUs ... under the Stock Plans' is a grants-in-period fact for equity instruments other than options (RSUs). Instrument-class-first and grants-in-period rules (ctx-00008, ctx-00007) indicate mapping the number of RSUs granted to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\\n\\nQ3: 'weighted average grant date fair value of $56.61 per share' is the weighted-average grant-date fair value for the equity (RSU) grants. The precise tag for that metric for equity-instruments-other-than-options is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue (ctx-00008, ctx-00007).\\n\\nQ4: '3,800,000 shares ... reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP' includes a plan anchor (2016 ESPP) and a 'reserved' authorization phrase. Per plan-specific authorization rules (ctx-00001 and ctx-00007), reserved-for-plan amounts map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized.\\n\\nI reviewed potential alternatives (CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance or 'available for grant' tags) and applied the playbook precedence: plan-anchor + 'reserved' -> plan-authorized tag; 'available for grant' -> available-for-grant tag; and RSUs -> equity-other-than-options grants.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's four mappings to the ground truth and the sentences. Q1–Q3 were correct: the model correctly recognized \\\"still available for grant\\\" as the number of shares available for grant under stock plans, the RSU grant count as grants-in-period for equity instruments other than options, and the dollar figure as the weighted-average grant-date fair value of those grants. The only mismatch is Q4. The sentence is: \\\"A total of 3,800,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP.\\\" The model mapped this to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized (a plan-authorized share-based-compensation tag). The ground truth maps it to CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance (a common-stock-equity tag). The model appears to have applied the general \\\"plan-anchor + reserved -> share-based compensation authorized\\\" rule too broadly, without distinguishing the plan type or the corporate-equity context signaled by \\\"class A common stock\\\" and \\\"ESPP\\\". In practice, an ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan) reserved-share statement is usually a corporate equity reserved-for-issuance disclosure and is tagged with CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance rather than the ShareBasedCompensationArrangement...NumberOfSharesAuthorized tag. So the model misapplied the playbook precedence for reserved shares when the plan is an ESPP (or when the text emphasizes \\\"Class A common stock\\\" and \\\"reserved for issuance\\\" rather than \\\"reserved for issuance of equity awards under the Stock Plans\\\").\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The incorrect mapping is only for Q4: the model chose the plan-authorized share-based-compensation tag instead of the common-stock reserved-for-future-issuance tag. It overgeneralized the \\\"reserved\\\" + \\\"plan\\\" rule and failed to detect that ESPP reservations should be tagged as CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The core misunderstanding is conflating two different disclosure categories that both use the word \\\"reserved\\\": (a) share-based compensation plan authorizations/allocations (tags under ShareBasedCompensationArrangementBy...) and (b) corporate equity shares reserved for future issuance (CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance). The model's playbook application prioritized a generic plan-anchor rule without checking for plan type (ESPP) or equity context cues ('Class A common stock', 'reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP'), which should steer the decision to the common-stock tag.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Introduce a disambiguation step when encountering 'reserved' + 'plan' phrasing: check the plan type and the noun being reserved. If the sentence references 'Class A common stock', 'common stock', or an 'ESPP'/'Employee Stock Purchase Plan', prefer CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance. Reserve ShareBasedCompensationArrangementBy...NumberOfSharesAuthorized for contexts explicitly about 'equity awards', 'awards reserved', 'stock plans' that are clearly share-based-compensation arrangements (options, RSUs, grants). In practice, implement a rule like: if 'ESPP' or 'Employee Stock Purchase Plan' present OR the reserved item is explicitly named as 'shares of common stock reserved for issuance', map to CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance; otherwise, if the surrounding text mentions 'awards', 'available for grant', 'stock plans' as award mechanisms, map to the ShareBasedCompensationArrangementBy... authorized tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Do not treat every 'reserved' + 'plan' phrase the same. Use plan type and the reserved instrument noun as decisive signals: 'ESPP' or explicit 'common stock' reservation => CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance; 'reserved for issuance of equity awards' or 'stock plans' for awards => ShareBasedCompensationArrangement...NumberOfSharesAuthorized.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
