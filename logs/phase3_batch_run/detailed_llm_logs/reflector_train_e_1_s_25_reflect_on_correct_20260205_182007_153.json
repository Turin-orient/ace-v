Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"7.625\" in sentence: \"AK Steel has outstanding 7.625 % Senior Notes due October 2021 ( the “ 2021 Notes ” ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.625\" in sentence: \"The 2021 Notes were issued under a supplemental indenture , which includes covenants and restrictions substantially similar to the existing indentures governing the 7.625 % Senior Notes due 2020 and the 8.375 % Senior Notes due 2022 and are equal in right of payment to those notes .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"8.375\" in sentence: \"The 2021 Notes were issued under a supplemental indenture , which includes covenants and restrictions substantially similar to the existing indentures governing the 7.625 % Senior Notes due 2020 and the 8.375 % Senior Notes due 2022 and are equal in right of payment to those notes .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"103.813\" in sentence: \"Before October 1 , 2017 , we may redeem the 2021 Notes at a price equal to par plus a make whole premium and all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption After that date , they are redeemable at 103.813 % until October 1 , 2018 , 101.906 % thereafter until October 1 , 2019 , and 100.0 % thereafter , together with all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Applied issuance-percentage heuristics: percentages adjacent to named debt instruments (e.g., '7.625% Senior Notes') map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage per the percent-on-issued-debt and unit/anchor validation rules.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read each sentence and used the linguistic anchors to determine whether the percentage refers to an interest/stated coupon rate or to a redemption/repurchase price. Sentences 1–3 present percentages directly attached to labeled debt instruments (e.g., \\\"7.625% Senior Notes\\\", \\\"8.375% Senior Notes\\\"), which is the canonical phrasing for a stated interest/coupon rate on a debt instrument. Therefore those map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Sentence 4 is a redemption clause describing prices at which the notes are redeemable (\\\"redeemable at 103.813% ... 101.906% ... 100.0%\\\"), so those percentages are redemption price percentages, mapping to DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage. I also distinguished the make-whole reference (par plus make-whole premium) from the specified percentage redemption prices; the latter are explicit redemption-price percentages.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"There was no error: the model's tag assignments matched the ground truth exactly. The percentages adjacent to the note names were correctly identified as stated interest rates, and the redemption clause percentages were correctly identified as redemption-price percentages.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable for this instance because the model applied the correct interpretations. A general potential pitfall (not realized here) would be conflating other percentage types (e.g., conversion prices, discount/premium on issuance, or amortization rates) with interest or redemption percentages if contextual anchors are ignored.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using contextual anchors: (1) If a percentage directly modifies the debt instrument name (\\\"X% Senior Notes\\\"), tag as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. (2) If the percentage appears in a redemption/repurchase clause (\\\"redeemable at X%\\\", \\\"redeemed at X%\\\"), tag as DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage. Verify by checking for verbs/nouns like 'due', 'notes', 'issued' for rates and 'redeem', 'redeemable', 'redemption', 'price' for redemption percentages.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Rule-of-thumb: 'X% [DebtInstrumentName]' -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 'redeemable at X%', 'redeem at X%' or explicit redemption-price language -> DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage. Use surrounding verbs and nouns as decisive anchors.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
