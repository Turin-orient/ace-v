Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"144.5\" in sentence: \"As of December 31 , 2018 , the future maturities of long - term debt were as follows : Letters of Credit As of December 31 , 2018 , the Company had approximately $ 144.5 million outstanding in letters of credit and guarantees with financial institutions , which expire on various dates in 2019 through 2028 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"300,000\" in sentence: \"The Company has designated the € 300,000 and € 600,000 of euro - denominated notes issued December 4 , 2013 and November 9 , 2016 , respectively , as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro - denominated operations .?\"\n3.

What is best tag for entity \"3,132,330\" in sentence: \"The estimated fair value of long - term debt at December 31 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 3,132,330 and $ 3,324,776 , respectively , compared to the carrying value of $ 2,943,660 and $ 2,986,702 , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief rationale (concise, non-sensitive): 1) Sentence explicitly states $144.5 million \\\"outstanding in letters of credit\\\" → maps to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount per credit-facility/letters-of-credit guidance. 2) & 3) The €300,000 and €600,000 are amounts of euro-denominated notes (stated as notes issued on specific dates) — these represent the instruments' principal/face amounts → map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. 4) 3,132,330 is described as the \\\"estimated fair value of long-term debt\\\" → map to LongTermDebtFairValue.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00009\", \"ctx-00005\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,LongTermDebtFairValue\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nLettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,LongTermDebtFairValue\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,LongTermDebtFairValue\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined each sentence and matched the numeric entity to the tag in the provided US GAAP vocabulary by identifying the financial concept described, not just the number. For Q1 the sentence states the Company had \\\"$144.5 million outstanding in letters of credit and guarantees\\\" — the phrase \\\"outstanding in letters of credit\\\" directly describes the outstanding amount of letters of credit, so LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount is the correct tag. For Q2 and Q3 the text describes \\\"€300,000 and €600,000 ... euro-denominated notes issued ...\\\" — these are the principal/face amounts of debt instruments (notes issued), so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is the correct tag for both. For Q4 the sentence explicitly calls the number the \\\"estimated fair value of long-term debt\\\" — that maps to LongTermDebtFairValue. The model applied straightforward semantic mapping from the descriptive phrase to the matching tag in the taxonomy and returned the four tags in order.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No errors: the model's reasoning and final tag choices match the ground truth exactly. There were no mis-mappings or calculation mistakes in this case.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable (no mistake). A potential area where errors commonly occur — but did not here — is confusing similar concepts (e.g., face amount vs. carrying amount vs. fair value). That confusion did not occur in this trace.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The approach used is correct: (1) read the phrase surrounding the number to determine the financial concept (outstanding letters of credit, notes issued/face amount, estimated fair value of debt); (2) locate the exact matching tag in the vocabulary that corresponds to that concept; (3) output the tags in the order of the questions. If ambiguity exists, prefer the tag that precisely matches the descriptor (e.g., choose LongTermDebtFairValue when the text says \\\"fair value,\\\" DebtInstrumentFaceAmount when it refers to \\\"notes issued\\\" or principal).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map the descriptive wording (e.g., \\\"outstanding in letters of credit,\\\" \\\"notes issued,\\\" \\\"estimated fair value\\\") to taxonomy tag names literally and precisely. Watch for commonly confused pairs: face amount (DebtInstrumentFaceAmount) vs. carrying amount (DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount) vs. fair value (LongTermDebtFairValue).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
