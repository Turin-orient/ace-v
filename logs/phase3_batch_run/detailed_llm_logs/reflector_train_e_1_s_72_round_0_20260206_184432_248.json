Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared each predicted tag to the ground truth and examined the sentence context to locate the mismatch. For the first three items (53, 79, 439) the model mapped the numbers to loss contingency tags. The sentence for 53 explicitly said the Company \\\"has recognized aggregate liabilities\\\" for claims of approximately $53 million — that language corresponds to an accrual (carrying value) for loss contingencies, so LossContingencyAccrualAtCarryingValue is appropriate. The $79 and $439 figures are described as the estimated range of potential losses for reasonably possible contingencies (not recognized accruals), so mapping both to LossContingencyEstimateOfPossibleLoss is correct. The fourth item (40) is where the model erred: the sentence says AES \\\"indirectly acquired the 40% ownership interest of the noncontrolling shareholder for a de minimis payment, and sold a 6.7% interest...\\\" The verb \\\"acquired\\\" indicates a transaction (an acquisition of an ownership percentage). The correct tag (ground truth) is BusinessAcquisitionPercentageOfVotingInterestsAcquired, which specifically captures the percentage of voting interests acquired in a business acquisition. The model instead chose MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByNoncontrollingOwners, which describes a static reporting of the percentage owned by noncontrolling owners, not the percentage acquired in a transaction. I verified the grammatical cues: the presence of an acquisition action (acquired) plus the object (40% ownership interest) signals that this is an acquisition event and should map to the business-acquisition-percentage tag.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the 40% figure by treating it as a static ownership percentage of noncontrolling owners rather than as the percentage acquired in a transaction. In short, it ignored the acquisition verb and treated the numeric phrase as a simple ownership statistic.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The conceptual error was conflating two different tag meanings: (a) a tag for reporting the percentage ownership held by noncontrolling owners, and (b) a tag for the percentage of voting interests acquired in a business acquisition. The model matched on the noun phrase \\\"40% ownership interest\\\" but failed to incorporate the verb/action context ('acquired'), which is crucial for choosing the acquisition-related tag. This reflects an insufficient emphasis on action verbs and transaction context when mapping numbers to tags.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should (1) parse the sentence to identify action verbs related to the numeric entity (e.g., 'acquired', 'sold', 'issued', 'repurchased'); (2) if the number is tied to a transaction verb (acquired/sold/issued/etc.), prefer acquisition/transaction tags (e.g., BusinessAcquisitionPercentageOfVotingInterestsAcquired) rather than static ownership tags; (3) if the number describes a reported balance or a standing ownership percentage without transaction verbs, use ownership/interest tags (e.g., MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByNoncontrollingOwners). Concretely for this sentence: detect 'acquired' + '40% ownership interest' -> select BusinessAcquisitionPercentageOfVotingInterestsAcquired.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When mapping numeric entities to US GAAP tags, always incorporate the sentence-level action context. Numbers tied to verbs indicating transactions (acquired, sold, issued, repurchased) generally map to acquisition/transaction tags; numbers presented as static measurements or balances without transaction verbs map to ownership/position tags or balance-related tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
