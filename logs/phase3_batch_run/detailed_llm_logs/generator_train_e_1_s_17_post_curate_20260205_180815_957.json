Anti-pattern: tagging both an 'aggregate purchase price of $X' and an 'aggregate consideration of $Y' with the same 'consideration' tag. Concrete prevention: enforce lexical-match-first rule (if 'purchase price' appears, do not map that phrase to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1). Add a unit-test: example sentence 'aggregate purchase price of $162 million' must map to PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross; 'aggregate consideration of $1.2 billion' must map to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1.\n[err-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-patterns and prevention rules (atomic): - Anti-pattern: mapping any 'per share' price to SaleOfStockPricePerShare without checking instrument class. Prevention: before assigning SaleOfStockPricePerShare check for convertible/preferred/mandatory cues in same sentence; if present, map to convertible-specific price tag. - Anti-pattern: treating 'we sold X shares' as a generic secondary sale when underwriter/overallotment/offer language is present. Prevention: if 'we sold' co-occurs with underwriter/overallotment/overallotment exercise/offer language within ±1 sentence, treat as primary issuance and map share counts to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - Anti-pattern: applying nearest-lexical-match only. Prevention: implement precedence override: instrument-type and offering flags must be evaluated and can override nearest lexical match. - Add unit-tests for regressions: include at least 10 sentences mixing convertible language with 'per share' and 'sold' / 'offered' / 'underwriters' to ensure convertible/issuance tags win over generic sale tags.\n[err-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: err-XXXX :: Anti-pattern: blanket-mapping 'availability' -> RemainingBorrowingCapacity. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n- Do not assign RemainingBorrowingCapacity solely because the word 'availability' appears. First check for a facility-capacity anchor in same or previous sentence (\"has a $X credit facility\", \"in an aggregate principal amount of up to $X\").\n- If 'availability' is used in a comparative clause referencing a previously stated cap (\"may be less than $X\" where X == stated cap), map to MaximumBorrowingCapacity (the sentence is comparing to the contractual cap or describing an effective cap constraint).\n- If the phrase contains explicit current-amount tokens (\"amount available under the facility totaled\", \"was available under the facility\"), map to RemainingBorrowingCapacity.\n- If no anchor and no explicit remaining-amount phrase exist, mark as ambiguous and require human review instead of auto-mapping.\n- Add automated unit-tests for both positive and negative examples and log ambiguous cases for retraining.\n[err-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Tie-breaker: prefer instrument-specific mapping over generic financial-category tags when instrument anchor present (atomic prevention rule): - Anti-pattern: mapping an 'interest' currency amount to generic InterestExpense or mapping a 'per annum' percentage to a spread tag without checking instrument context. - Prevention checklist (apply in order): 1) If numeric token is percentage AND 'per annum'/'per year' present AND any instrument-anchor (note/loan/term loan/seller note) in sentence ±1 -> map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 2) If numeric token is currency AND interest lexical cue ('interest charges', 'interest expense', 'interest on') AND instrument-anchor in sentence ±1 -> map to InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument anchor). 3) If both 'spread'/'margin' and 'per annum' cues occur, prefer per-annum/stated-rate mapping; log conflict for QA. 4) If customer + revenue percent detected, map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1; do not map to generic 'percentage' tags. 5) If instrument-anchor is absent for interest-charge currency amounts, map to generic InterestExpense and flag for human review; add the sentence to a retraining queue. - Unit-tests: include all examples referenced in the above heuristics and assert instrument-specific tags beat generic alternatives.\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Atomic negation-to-zero rule for availability quantities (prevention of treating negation as 'absent' rather than numeric zero). Purpose: ensure explicit negative availability phrases ('no', 'none', 'not available') are normalized to numeric zero for quantity tags and mapped to the most specific availability tag. Rules:\n1) Negation cues (case-insensitive regex examples): /\\bno\\b/, /\\bnone\\b/, /\\bnot\\s+available\\b/, /\\bthere\\s+are\\s+no\\b/, /\\bzero\\b/ within ±6 tokens of an availability noun ('available', 'remain', 'remain\\s+available', 'available\\s+for\\s+grant').\n2) Quantity mapping: when negation cue co-occurs with availability noun and a plan/instrument anchor as applicable (e.g., 'under the Plan', 'under the facility'), assign numeric value 0 and map to the specific quantity tag (e.g., ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0; LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = $0 when explicit 'amount available under the facility was $0' or 'no availability under the credit facility').\n3) Scope constraints (do NOT apply universal zero conversion): do not convert negations that apply to non-quantity facts or idiomatic phrases ('no material impact', 'no change', 'no further details'); require proximity to a numeric/quantity noun and an anchor.\n4) Tag-type constraint: only auto-convert to zero for quantity/amount-of-shares/remaining-capacity numeric tags; do not auto-convert percentages unless explicit context indicates 'zero percent' (e.g., 'no revenue' vs 'zero percent of revenue' are different; flag ambiguous percent-negations for review).\n5) Token-window & antecedent resolution: allow antecedent anchors in previous sentence up to ±1 sentence when anaphoric phrase 'the Plan'/'the facility' is used; require confidence threshold for cross-sentence negation mapping; otherwise flag for human review.\n6) Unit-tests/examples to add:\n   - 'no shares remain available under the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan' -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0.\n   - 'There are no amounts available under the credit facility' -> LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = 0.\n   - 'No material impact was expected' -> do NOT map to any numeric tag (must be filtered by scope constraint).\n7) Logging: any auto-zero assignment should be recorded with the negation cue span and the anchor span for traceability and QA.\n[err-00004] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern prevention: Do not map currency amounts labeled as 'interest charges'/'interest expense' to generic InterestExpense when an instrument-anchor is present; instead map to InterestExpenseDebt and normalize explicit zeros. - Exact lexical cues (case-insensitive): /interest\\s+charge(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+expense(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+on\\s+the\\s+(note|notes|loan|term\\s+loan|seller\\s+note|revolver)/i. - Instrument-anchor detection: detect instrument names (Seller Notes, Term Loan, Revolver, Senior Notes, etc.) in same sentence OR previous sentence (allow antecedent resolution up to ±1 sentence and span <= 40 tokens). - Association window: currency numeric token within ±12 tokens of interest lexical cue (primary) and instrument-anchor within ±40 tokens across sentence boundary if needed. - Mapping rule: if both interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present -> assign InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument id). If interest lexical cue present but no instrument-anchor -> assign generic InterestExpense and flag 'interest-amount-no-instrument' for review. - Zero/numeric normalization: if the numeric token is explicit 'zero', 'no interest', 'none' appearing within ±6 tokens of interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present, normalize to numeric 0 and assign InterestExpenseDebt = 0; log negation cue span and anchor span for traceability. - Precedence: this instrument-specific mapping overrides any generic expense or cash-flow tag. - Unit-tests (atomic): - '$179,507 of interest charges associated with the Seller Notes for the year' -> $179,507 = InterestExpenseDebt (Seller Notes). - 'No interest expense was recorded on the Term Loan' -> InterestExpenseDebt = 0 (Term Loan), logged. - '$331,397 of interest expense for the six months ended June 30 related to the Term Loan' -> $331,397 = InterestExpenseDebt. - Logging: record instrument anchor span and interest phrase span for each mapping for QA and retraining; aggregate 'interest-amount-no-instrument' cases into review queue.\n[err-00003] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: err-000XX :: Heuristic-use logging and auto-linking rule (atomic prevention of traceability inconsistencies): Purpose: ensure every auto-assigned tag that corresponds to a playbook heuristic is recorded with that heuristic id and supporting evidence; detect and correct cases where tag assignment and playbook-bullet usage are inconsistent.\nRules (apply at tag-assignment time, deterministic steps):\n1) Heuristic-match pass (post-tag decision): run a deterministic heuristic-matcher over the sentence/span using the canonical set of playbook heuristics (use same regexes/token-windows as playbook bullets) and compute for each bullet: match_score = sum(matched_cues_weight) - distance_penalty. Use identical precedence rules as the playbook.\n2) If the assigned tag equals the top-scoring playbook bullet's canonical mapping AND match_score >= MATCH_THRESHOLD (e.g., 0.7), then automatically attach the following fields to the annotation: { attached_bullet_id: <id>, match_score: <float>, matched_cue_spans: [ { cue_text, start_token, end_token } ], numeric_span: { start_token, end_token }, evidence_sentence_id }.\n3) If the assigned tag equals a playbook canonical mapping but no bullet matched with score >= MATCH_THRESHOLD, create a derived_bullet record with id derived-<hash> containing the observed cue patterns, numeric span, sentence, and system-generated regex; attach derived_bullet_id to the annotation and add the derived record to the 'to-review' queue.\n4) If the generator attempted to attach 'no playbook bullet used' but the post-decision heuristic-match finds a bullet with match_score >= MATCH_THRESHOLD, override 'no-bullet' flag by attaching the matched bullet id and log an inconsistency event: { event: 'bullet-missing-on-output', predicted_tag, matched_bullet_id, match_score, run_id }.\n5) If the assigned tag does NOT correspond to any existing bullet mapping, attach explicit { attached_bullet_id: null, reason: 'no-bullet-match', top_candidate_bullets: [ {id, match_score} ] } and queue example for playbook author review if top_candidate match_score >= REVIEW_THRESHOLD (e.g., 0.5).\n6) Mandatory trace fields (always attach these to each numeric-tag annotation): { tag_assigned, numeric_span_tokens, anchor_span_tokens (if any), attached_bullet_id (or derived id or null), match_score, matched_cue_texts, confidence_score, provenance: { model_version, pipeline_version, timestamp } }.\n7) Post-commit validator: after annotation commit, run a validator that checks 'if tag_assigned in canonical_playbook_map and attached_bullet_id not equal canonical_id then emit error-level QA record and auto-attach canonical_id (idempotent). Example: if tag_assigned == ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 and canonical bullet==ctx-00013 but attached_bullet_id==null -> auto-attach ctx-00013 and create QA record.\n8) Unit-tests (atomic examples to add to CI):\n   - Sentence: 'Tech Data accounted for 32% of total net revenue for the year' -> expected: ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 attached_bullet_id == 'ctx-00013', matched_cue_spans include 'of total net revenue' and 'Tech Data'.\n   - Negative: 'Random percent in unrelated sentence' -> if no playbook bullet matches, attached_bullet_id == null and top_candidate_bullets list empty or low scores.\n   - Inconsistency detection: simulate pipeline that would earlier output 'no bullet used' but matches ctx-00013 on validator; assert validator auto-attaches ctx-00013 and emits QA record 'bullet-missing-on-output'.\n9) Logging & QA metrics: record counts and example lists for (a) auto-attached bullets, (b) derived bullets created, (c) inconsistency corrections. Surface these in weekly QA dashboard and include example spans for human review. Persist match_score thresholds and allow hyperparameter tuning, but require explicit change-log entry when thresholds are updated.\n10) Implementation notes: Implement this rule as a lightweight deterministic post-processing module in the tagging pipeline (idempotent). It must run the same matching logic as playbook bullets to avoid mismatch. Add regression tests to ensure existing high-confidence mappings (e.g., ctx-00013 -> customer concentration percent -> ConcentrationRiskPercentage1) always result in attached_bullet_id == ctx-00013.\n[err-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: [err-xxxx] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern: equating 'recognized' with 'vested' in share-based compensation disclosures. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n\n1) Detection: if sentence contains verb 'recognized'/'recorded'/'expensed' within ±8 tokens of numeric token, do NOT map to any 'vested' fair-value tag unless explicit 'vested' AND 'fair value' are both present (within ±6 tokens).\n2) If sentence contains 'unrecognized' + 'expected to be recognized' or 'weighted-average period' in proximity to the numeric token, do NOT map to award-vesting-period tags; instead map period to the 'PeriodForRecognition' tag (only when unrecognized-cost cue present).\n3) Disambiguation priority (use before labeling): expense-recognition verbs > unrecognized-recognition-period cues > vested+fair-value cues > generic 'period'/'vesting' lexical matches.\n4) Unit-tests to add to CI to prevent regression: include at least 6 sentences mixing 'recognized', 'vested', 'fair value', and 'weighted-average' in different permutations showing correct/incorrect mappings (examples from ctx-xxxx unit-tests). Failing any unit-test should block model auto-assignment for that pattern and trigger human-review.\n5) Training data capture: whenever the system would have mapped 'recognized' -> vested-fair-value but the precedence rule chooses AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense, log the positive example (sentence, predicted tag, corrected tag) into a 'recognized-vs-vested' training bucket for model fine-tuning.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n[ph-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Delta decision flow (apply in order for each numeric token): 1) Sentence-level scan: detect instrument-type cues (convertible/preferred/mandatory) and offering cues (underwriters, overallotment, offering language) across the sentence ±1 surrounding sentence. 2) If instrument-type == convertible: - If numeric token is a price or appears adjacent to unit tokens like 'per share', 'per common share', 'per depositary share': assign DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1 unless an explicit secondary-market sale cue is present. - If numeric token is shares and offering cues present: assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. 3) If offering cues present (even if instrument-type absent): - If numeric token is number-of-shares -> assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (primary issuance). - If numeric token is price and context uses 'offering price', 'issued at', 'offering at' -> prefer issuance-price tag (if available) else flag for review. 4) If no instrument-type or offering cues: use existing lexical-to-tag mapping (e.g., 'sold' -> SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction) as fallback. 5) Tie-breaker precedence (high -> low): instrument-specific issuance tags (convertible conversion price, mandatory-convertible issuance) > issuance/share-specific tags (StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues) > generic sale tags (SaleOfStock*). 6) Ambiguity handling: if fallback mapping would assign a generic sale tag but any instrument/offering cue matched (score difference < threshold), flag the example and record sentence+reason for human review and training. 7) Unit-test generation examples to add to test suite: - \"We sold 17,250,000 shares, including the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option\" -> 17,250,000 = StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - \"Sempra Energy 6% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, was issued at $100.00 per share\" -> $100.00 = DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1. - \"We sold 500,000 shares on the open market\" -> 500,000 = SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction.\n[ph-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Delta decision flow for tax-rate-percentage mapping (apply for each percentage token): 1) Sentence-level scan: detect tax-reconciliation anchors ('effective tax-rate reconciliation', 'reconciliation of effective tax rate', 'reconciled to') anywhere in the sentence or immediately preceding sentence (±1). 2) Detect statutory-rate cues (use lexical rule above). 3) If BOTH (a) reconciliation anchor present AND (b) 'federal'/'U.S.'/'statutory' tax-rate cue present within allowed windows -> deterministically assign EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate to the nearest percentage token. 4) Tie-breaker: if more than one statutory-like cue exists, prefer the percent whose token-distance to the phrase 'federal statutory' is smallest; if equal, prefer the percent that co-occurs with the word 'rate' or the explicit phrase 'statutory'. 5) If reconciliation anchor is present but 'federal' qualifier is missing, prefer tag only when textual context explicitly references 'statutory' and jurisdiction 'U.S.'; otherwise flag as 'tax-rate-ambiguous-jurisdiction' and queue for human review (do not auto-map to federal statutory tag). 6) If other percentage-mapping heuristics (e.g., spreads, concentration) are also triggered, enforce precedence: statutory-reconciliation mapping > concentration/customer mapping > spread/basis mapping > generic percentage mapping. 7) Unit-tests to add: - 'Reconciled to the federal statutory income tax rate of 35%.' -> 35% = EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. - 'For the year ended, the U.S. statutory rate used in the reconciliation was 21%.' -> 21% = EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. - 'The statutory tax rate used in reconciliation was 25% (no jurisdiction specified)' -> flagged as 'tax-rate-ambiguous-jurisdiction'. 8) Logging: Always record reconciliation-anchor span, statutory-cue span, chosen numeric span, and applied tag for audit and retraining.\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n[ctx-00001] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Lexical-to-tag mapping (exact cues + variants).

Distance weighting: - When multiple cues present, compute score = (instrument_cue_present ? 10 : 0) + (offering_cue_present ? 8 : 0) + (1 / (1 + token_distance_to_numeric)).

Presence of only 'vested' without 'fair value' should not auto-map to VestedInPeriodTotalFairValue.\n\n3) Deterministic mapping rules & precedence (apply in order):\n   A) If numeric + (unrecognized-cost cue) + (expected-to-be-recognized OR weighted-average qualifier) -> assign EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognizedPeriodForRecognition1 for the PERIOD numeric tokens and EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized for related AMOUNT tokens (if present). Do NOT map to award-vesting-period tags even if 'period' appears; add anchor note recording 'weighted-average period for recognition'.\n   B) Else if numeric + recognized/recorded/expensed cue (verb forms above) -> assign AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense (map to expense/allocated tag). This captures sentences like 'The Company recognized $X of share-based compensation during the [period]'.\n   C) Else if numeric + BOTH 'vested' AND 'fair value' cues -> assign ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsVestedInPeriodTotalFairValue (vested-in-period total fair value tag).\n   D) Else if numeric + 'vested' cue ONLY (no 'fair value') -> do NOT auto-assign vested-fair-value tag; prefer human-review or consider other expense cues in sentence; log as 'vested-no-fairvalue-ambiguous'.\n   E) Else if numeric contains 'weighted-average' but no unrecognized-cost/unrecognized cue -> prefer human review: do NOT assume award-vesting-period. Only map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1 if explicit 'award-level vesting schedule' language appears (e.g., 'each award vests over X years' or 'vesting period of each award is X years').\n\n4) Anti-pattern rule (atomic): never map the phrase 'weighted-average period' found in context of 'unrecognized compensation cost' to an award vesting-period tag. The token window check in 2) and precedence in 3) enforce this.\n\n5) Unit-tests/examples to add (atomic):\n   - 'The Company recognized $3.2 million of share-based compensation during the three months ended March 31, 2018.' -> $3.2M = AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense.\n   - 'Total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.34 years.' -> 2.34 years = EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognizedPeriodForRecognition1 (and the unrecognized amount maps to NonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized if present).\n   - 'The total fair value of awards that vested during the period was $X.' -> $X = VestedInPeriodTotalFairValue (requires explicit 'fair value' + 'vested').\n   - 'The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding is X years' (explicit award-vesting schedule language) -> map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1 only when clause clearly describes award vesting schedule.\n\n6) Logging & QA: attach to each auto-assigned annotation: matched_cue_spans (which of the cue groups matched), mapping-rule-id ctx-xxxx, applied_precedence_clause (A/B/C), and a 'semantic_role' field with values { 'expense/allocated', 'vested_fair_value', 'recognition_period' }. Flag any sentence where 'recognized' and 'vested' both appear with conflicting numeric tags as 'recognized-vs-vested-conflict' and queue for human review.\n\n7) Implementation note: run this mapping before generic lexical fallbacks that equate 'period' -> vesting-period or 'recognized' -> vested; this deterministic module must consult tag definitions if available to verify 'PeriodForRecognition' vs 'AwardVestingPeriod' suffix semantics.\n[ctx-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: [ctx-00013a] helpful=1 harmful=0 :: Customer/Channel/Distributor revenue-anchor classifier + precedence (atomic heuristic) - Purpose: deterministically map percentages that quantify a share of revenue (customer concentration) to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 and avoid mis-mapping 'of X' percentages that refer to non-revenue metrics or other percentage concepts. - Exact lexical cue groups (case-insensitive regexes):   * CUSTOMER/DISTRIBUTOR/CHANNEL ENTITY CUES: /\\b(customer|customers|client|clients|clientele|distributor|distributors|reseller|resellers|channel|channel\\s+partner(s)?|partner(s)?|our\\s+largest\\s+customer|our\\s+two\\s+largest|one\\s+of\\s+our\\s+distributors)\\b/   * REVENUE-LINK CUES: /\\b(of\\s+(total\\s+)?(net\\s+)?revenue|of\\s+revenues|of\\s+revenue|accounted\\s+for|represented\\s+|represented\\s+(approximately|about)?|comprised\\s+of|constituted)\\b/   * CHANNEL-FORM CUES: /\\bthrough\\s+our\\s+(?:channel|distribution|reseller)\\s+(?:network|partners)|via\\s+our\\s+distributors\\b/ - Token association & antecedent windows:   1) Primary rule: assign ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 when a percentage token appears within ±10 tokens of at least one CUSTOMER/DISTRIBUTOR/CHANNEL ENTITY CUE AND within ±10 tokens of at least one REVENUE-LINK CUE in the same sentence.   2) Ancillary antecedent: allow 'the Channel/Distributor' or 'the customer' as anaphor resolved to an explicit named entity in the previous sentence up to ±1 sentence away (antecedent span <= 40 tokens). In that case apply mapping if combined token-distance from numeric to resolved entity cue + to revenue-link cue <= 50 tokens. - Precedence / conflict resolution (apply deterministically in order):   A) If ctx-00013a condition satisfied -> assign ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 and attach ctx-00013 (or ctx-00013a) as attached_bullet_id; this mapping MUST override other generic percentage heuristics (spread, per-annum interest, statutory tax) except when another heuristic has a stronger explicit anchor (e.g., 'per annum' + instrument anchor for interest-rate issuance).   B) If ctx-00013a condition partially satisfied (e.g., 'of revenue' present but no explicit customer/distributor entity; or customer entity present but no revenue-link) -> DO NOT auto-assign; mark as 'potential-concentration-ambiguous' and queue for human review (log candidate spans).   C) If percentage also matches other high-specificity heuristics (e.g., 'per annum' + loan instrument OR 'LIBOR plus' pattern OR 'federal statutory' + reconciliation anchor): compare anchor-specificity scores (anchors: statutory-reconciliation=10, per-annum+instrument=9, customer+revenue=8). Tie-breaker: require ctx-00013a to beat other heuristics by at least 1 point to auto-assign; otherwise defer to the higher-score mapping. Log all tie events as 'percent-anchor-conflict' with spans & scores. - Negative guardrails (explicit do-not-map patterns): do NOT map percentages to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 when any of the following appear within ±6 tokens of the percent: 'per annum', 'APR', 'margin', 'spread', 'LIBOR', 'ABR', 'statutory', 'effective tax', 'impairment', 'allocation', 'proration', 'of assets', 'of accounts', 'of consideration', 'of purchases', 'of backlog'. If both a revenue-anchor and a prohibited cue co-occur, treat as conflict and follow precedence rules above. - Logging & traceability: on every auto-assignment attach fields { attached_bullet_id: 'ctx-00013'|'ctx-00013a', match_score: float(0..1), matched_cue_spans: [ { cue_text, start_token, end_token } ], numeric_span: { start_token, end_token }, provenance: { module:'ctx-00013a', timestamp } }. If mapping deferred, attach reason code 'potential-concentration-ambiguous' or 'percent-anchor-conflict' and queue example for human review. - Unit-tests (atomic examples):   1) Positive: 'Tech Data accounted for 32% of total net revenue for the year' -> 32% = ConcentrationRiskPercentage1 (attach ctx-00013).   2) Positive-channel: '32% of revenue through our channel network' -> 32% = ConcentrationRiskPercentage1.   3) Positive-distributor: 'One of our distributors accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue' -> 27% = ConcentrationRiskPercentage1.   4) Negative-ambiguous: '32% of our sales were in Europe' (no customer entity) -> DO NOT auto-assign; flag 'potential-concentration-ambiguous'.   5) Negative-conflict: 'The interest rate is 4.00% per annum and we estimate 4.00% of revenue from one customer' (both forms) -> separate mappings: first -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (per-annum wins for that percent); second -> if percent tokens are identical ensure numeric-token disambiguation by proximity; if same token ambiguous, mark for review and log 'percent-anchor-conflict'. - Implementation note: integrate this classifier as an early percentage-disambiguation step (run before generic percentage fallbacks). Ensure post-decision validator (err-00003) auto-attaches ctx-00013 when match_score >= MATCH_THRESHOLD and raises QA record when classifier defers but playbook heuristic would have matched.
