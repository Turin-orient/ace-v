Anti-pattern: tagging both an 'aggregate purchase price of $X' and an 'aggregate consideration of $Y' with the same 'consideration' tag. Concrete prevention: enforce lexical-match-first rule (if 'purchase price' appears, do not map that phrase to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1). Add a unit-test: example sentence 'aggregate purchase price of $162 million' must map to PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross; 'aggregate consideration of $1.2 billion' must map to BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1.\n[err-00007] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-patterns and prevention rules (atomic): - Anti-pattern: mapping any 'per share' price to SaleOfStockPricePerShare without checking instrument class. Prevention: before assigning SaleOfStockPricePerShare check for convertible/preferred/mandatory cues in same sentence; if present, map to convertible-specific price tag. - Anti-pattern: treating 'we sold X shares' as a generic secondary sale when underwriter/overallotment/offer language is present. Prevention: if 'we sold' co-occurs with underwriter/overallotment/overallotment exercise/offer language within ±1 sentence, treat as primary issuance and map share counts to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - Anti-pattern: applying nearest-lexical-match only. Prevention: implement precedence override: instrument-type and offering flags must be evaluated and can override nearest lexical match. - Add unit-tests for regressions: include at least 10 sentences mixing convertible language with 'per share' and 'sold' / 'offered' / 'underwriters' to ensure convertible/issuance tags win over generic sale tags.\n[err-00010] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: err-XXXX :: Anti-pattern: blanket-mapping 'availability' -> RemainingBorrowingCapacity. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n- Do not assign RemainingBorrowingCapacity solely because the word 'availability' appears. First check for a facility-capacity anchor in same or previous sentence (\"has a $X credit facility\", \"in an aggregate principal amount of up to $X\").\n- If 'availability' is used in a comparative clause referencing a previously stated cap (\"may be less than $X\" where X == stated cap), map to MaximumBorrowingCapacity (the sentence is comparing to the contractual cap or describing an effective cap constraint).\n- If the phrase contains explicit current-amount tokens (\"amount available under the facility totaled\", \"was available under the facility\"), map to RemainingBorrowingCapacity.\n- If no anchor and no explicit remaining-amount phrase exist, mark as ambiguous and require human review instead of auto-mapping.\n- Add automated unit-tests for both positive and negative examples and log ambiguous cases for retraining.\n[err-00014] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Tie-breaker: prefer instrument-specific mapping over generic financial-category tags when instrument anchor present (atomic prevention rule): - Anti-pattern: mapping an 'interest' currency amount to generic InterestExpense or mapping a 'per annum' percentage to a spread tag without checking instrument context. - Prevention checklist (apply in order): 1) If numeric token is percentage AND 'per annum'/'per year' present AND any instrument-anchor (note/loan/term loan/seller note) in sentence ±1 -> map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 2) If numeric token is currency AND interest lexical cue ('interest charges', 'interest expense', 'interest on') AND instrument-anchor in sentence ±1 -> map to InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument anchor). 3) If both 'spread'/'margin' and 'per annum' cues occur, prefer per-annum/stated-rate mapping; log conflict for QA. 4) If customer + revenue percent detected, map to ConcentrationRiskPercentage1; do not map to generic 'percentage' tags. 5) If instrument-anchor is absent for interest-charge currency amounts, map to generic InterestExpense and flag for human review; add the sentence to a retraining queue. - Unit-tests: include all examples referenced in the above heuristics and assert instrument-specific tags beat generic alternatives.\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Atomic negation-to-zero rule for availability quantities (prevention of treating negation as 'absent' rather than numeric zero). Purpose: ensure explicit negative availability phrases ('no', 'none', 'not available') are normalized to numeric zero for quantity tags and mapped to the most specific availability tag. Rules:\n1) Negation cues (case-insensitive regex examples): /\\bno\\b/, /\\bnone\\b/, /\\bnot\\s+available\\b/, /\\bthere\\s+are\\s+no\\b/, /\\bzero\\b/ within ±6 tokens of an availability noun ('available', 'remain', 'remain\\s+available', 'available\\s+for\\s+grant').\n2) Quantity mapping: when negation cue co-occurs with availability noun and a plan/instrument anchor as applicable (e.g., 'under the Plan', 'under the facility'), assign numeric value 0 and map to the specific quantity tag (e.g., ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0; LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = $0 when explicit 'amount available under the facility was $0' or 'no availability under the credit facility').\n3) Scope constraints (do NOT apply universal zero conversion): do not convert negations that apply to non-quantity facts or idiomatic phrases ('no material impact', 'no change', 'no further details'); require proximity to a numeric/quantity noun and an anchor.\n4) Tag-type constraint: only auto-convert to zero for quantity/amount-of-shares/remaining-capacity numeric tags; do not auto-convert percentages unless explicit context indicates 'zero percent' (e.g., 'no revenue' vs 'zero percent of revenue' are different; flag ambiguous percent-negations for review).\n5) Token-window & antecedent resolution: allow antecedent anchors in previous sentence up to ±1 sentence when anaphoric phrase 'the Plan'/'the facility' is used; require confidence threshold for cross-sentence negation mapping; otherwise flag for human review.\n6) Unit-tests/examples to add:\n   - 'no shares remain available under the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan' -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant = 0.\n   - 'There are no amounts available under the credit facility' -> LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity = 0.\n   - 'No material impact was expected' -> do NOT map to any numeric tag (must be filtered by scope constraint).\n7) Logging: any auto-zero assignment should be recorded with the negation cue span and the anchor span for traceability and QA.\n[err-00004] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern prevention: Do not map currency amounts labeled as 'interest charges'/'interest expense' to generic InterestExpense when an instrument-anchor is present; instead map to InterestExpenseDebt and normalize explicit zeros. - Exact lexical cues (case-insensitive): /interest\\s+charge(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+expense(s)?\\b/, /interest\\s+on\\s+the\\s+(note|notes|loan|term\\s+loan|seller\\s+note|revolver)/i. - Instrument-anchor detection: detect instrument names (Seller Notes, Term Loan, Revolver, Senior Notes, etc.) in same sentence OR previous sentence (allow antecedent resolution up to ±1 sentence and span <= 40 tokens). - Association window: currency numeric token within ±12 tokens of interest lexical cue (primary) and instrument-anchor within ±40 tokens across sentence boundary if needed. - Mapping rule: if both interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present -> assign InterestExpenseDebt (link numeric to instrument id). If interest lexical cue present but no instrument-anchor -> assign generic InterestExpense and flag 'interest-amount-no-instrument' for review. - Zero/numeric normalization: if the numeric token is explicit 'zero', 'no interest', 'none' appearing within ±6 tokens of interest lexical cue and instrument-anchor present, normalize to numeric 0 and assign InterestExpenseDebt = 0; log negation cue span and anchor span for traceability. - Precedence: this instrument-specific mapping overrides any generic expense or cash-flow tag. - Unit-tests (atomic): - '$179,507 of interest charges associated with the Seller Notes for the year' -> $179,507 = InterestExpenseDebt (Seller Notes). - 'No interest expense was recorded on the Term Loan' -> InterestExpenseDebt = 0 (Term Loan), logged. - '$331,397 of interest expense for the six months ended June 30 related to the Term Loan' -> $331,397 = InterestExpenseDebt. - Logging: record instrument anchor span and interest phrase span for each mapping for QA and retraining; aggregate 'interest-amount-no-instrument' cases into review queue.\n[err-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: [err-XXXXX] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern: mapping any mention of 'Level 3' (or fair-value hierarchy) to DebtInstrumentFairValue without verifying explicit fair-value language or balance/date/VIE-listing context. Prevention checklist (atomic):\n1) Do NOT assign DebtInstrumentFairValue solely because the phrase 'Level 3' or 'Level 2' appears. Require an explicit fair-value cue ('fair value', 'measured at fair value', 'at fair value') within ±8 tokens to justify a fair-value tag.\n2) If numeric amounts are shown with date anchors ('as of', 'at [date]') or in table/note listing context or adjacent to 'VIE'/'variable interest entity' language, prefer DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount unless explicit fair-value language is present.\n3) If 'Level X' and 'fair value' both appear, map to DebtInstrumentFairValue; if 'Level X' appears with 'as of'/'included'/'carrying' map to DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount; if both classes of cues are present, log and flag for human review under 'fairvalue-vs-carrying-conflict'.\n4) Add unit-tests covering each anti-pattern and expected mapping (include the $297/$305 VIE example). 5) Log all 'level-only-ambiguous' mappings for manual QA and include them in retraining batches.\n[err-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Anti-pattern prevention: Do NOT map any 'exercise price' + 'per share' phrase to generic price-per-share/sale tags without first checking instrument-anchor (atomic checklist):\n1) Before assigning SaleOfStockPricePerShare or generic PricePerShare: search same sentence ±1 sentence for instrument-anchor tokens: /warrant(s)?\\b/, /right(s)?\\s+to\\s+purchase\\b/, /option(s)?\\b/, /convertible\\b/. If found, prefer instrument-specific exercise-price tag (warrant/option/convertible-conversion-price) that matches anchor. \n2) If anchor == 'warrant' or 'right' -> assign ClassOfWarrantOrRightExercisePriceOfWarrantsOrRights1. If anchor == 'option' -> assign option-exercise-price tag. If anchor == 'convertible' -> assign convertible-conversion price tag. \n3) If multiple anchors (e.g., 'warrants and options') use nearest-token distance to numeric; if tie, prefer the anchor explicitly adjacent to the phrase 'exercise price' or the most-specific named instrument in sentence. \n4) If no anchor found within ±1 sentence -> DO NOT auto-assign instrument-specific tag; either (a) map to generic SaleOfStockPricePerShare only if offering/sale language strongly indicates a sale-price (e.g., 'offering price', 'issued at'), otherwise (b) flag 'exercise-price-no-instrument' for human review. \n5) Add unit-tests to cover: warrant-exercise-price, option-exercise-price, convertible-conversion-price, and exercise-price with absent instrument anchor to ensure generic-sale tags do not win by default.\n6) Logging: every time the anti-pattern would have applied (generic mapping prevented), log 'prevented-generic-exercise-price-mapping' with spans and chosen mapping reason for QA.\n[err-00009] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Prevent misclassification of defined-contribution plan costs vs defined-benefit disclosures (atomic heuristic)\n- Purpose: ensure sentences describing 'net cost' or 'net contribution' of DC/defined contribution plans map to DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized (expense/contribution) and are not misclassified as defined-benefit pension items or generic pension-note amounts. \n- Exact lexical cues/patterns (case-insensitive regexes): /\\bdefined\\s+contribution\\b|\\bDC\\s+plan(s)?\\b|\\bdefined\\s+contribution\\s+plans?\\b/, net-cost cues: /\\bnet\\s+cost\\b|\\bnet\\s+contribution\\b|\\bemployer'?s?\\s+required\\s+contribution\\b|\\bwas\\s+\\$?[0-9,.]+\\b|\\bcontribution\\s+required\\b|\\bcontributed\\b/, explanatory equality cues: /=|equals|was\\s+the\\s+employer'?s?\\s+required\\s+contribution|which\\s+equals/i. \n- Association windows: require both a DC anchor and a currency numeric token in same sentence OR DC anchor in previous sentence (±1 sentence antecedent resolution allowed, span <= 40 tokens). Primary numeric-distance window = ±12 tokens around numeric for mapping. \n- Precedence & decision flow: 1) If sentence contains DC anchor + 'net cost'/'net contribution' + currency numeric -> assign DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized and link numeric to DC plan identity if present. 2) If 'net cost' appears but anchor ambiguous between DC and DB (defined benefit), prefer DC mapping only when explicit 'defined contribution'/'DC' or 'employer's required contribution' tied to contribution semantics is present; otherwise flag for human review rather than auto-mapping to DB tags. 3) If the sentence states 'net cost of the DC plans was $X and equals employer's required contribution' -> deterministically map to DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized = $X. \n- Anti-pattern prevention: do NOT assign DefinedBenefitPlanCost or pension actuarial tags when 'defined contribution' lexical cue present; do not rely on generic 'pension'/'benefit' words without explicit 'defined benefit' anchor. \n- Unit-tests/examples to add:  - 'The net cost of the DC plans for the year was $9 million, which equals the employer's required contribution.' -> $9M = DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized.  - 'Employer contributions to our defined contribution plan were $4.2M' -> $4.2M = DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized.  - 'Net pension cost for defined benefit plans was $2M' -> map to DefinedBenefitPlanCost (do not conflate). \n- Logging: record DC-anchor span, net-cost phrase span, numeric span and mapping decision; flag any auto-mapped DC cost where 'pension' or 'benefit' words also appear nearby as 'dc-vs-db-proximity' for QA.\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n[ph-00006] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Delta decision flow (apply in order for each numeric token): 1) Sentence-level scan: detect instrument-type cues (convertible/preferred/mandatory) and offering cues (underwriters, overallotment, offering language) across the sentence ±1 surrounding sentence. 2) If instrument-type == convertible: - If numeric token is a price or appears adjacent to unit tokens like 'per share', 'per common share', 'per depositary share': assign DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1 unless an explicit secondary-market sale cue is present. - If numeric token is shares and offering cues present: assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. 3) If offering cues present (even if instrument-type absent): - If numeric token is number-of-shares -> assign StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (primary issuance). - If numeric token is price and context uses 'offering price', 'issued at', 'offering at' -> prefer issuance-price tag (if available) else flag for review. 4) If no instrument-type or offering cues: use existing lexical-to-tag mapping (e.g., 'sold' -> SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction) as fallback. 5) Tie-breaker precedence (high -> low): instrument-specific issuance tags (convertible conversion price, mandatory-convertible issuance) > issuance/share-specific tags (StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues) > generic sale tags (SaleOfStock*). 6) Ambiguity handling: if fallback mapping would assign a generic sale tag but any instrument/offering cue matched (score difference < threshold), flag the example and record sentence+reason for human review and training. 7) Unit-test generation examples to add to test suite: - \"We sold 17,250,000 shares, including the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option\" -> 17,250,000 = StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - \"Sempra Energy 6% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, was issued at $100.00 per share\" -> $100.00 = DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1. - \"We sold 500,000 shares on the open market\" -> 500,000 = SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction.\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n[ctx-00001] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Lexical-to-tag mapping (exact cues + variants).

Sale / secondary-market indicators (inverse cues): /\\bwe sold to third parties\\b/, /\\bsecondary offering\\b/, /\\btraded on\\b/, /\\bsold on the market\\b/. Numeric association window policy: - Primary association window = ±8 tokens around numeric token. - If an instrument-type cue appears anywhere in the same sentence, treat instrument-type as global for that numeric token (i.e., instrument cues outrank local lexical matches within window). - If offering cue appears in same sentence or adjacent sentence (±1 sentence), mark transaction as primary issuance. Precedence mapping rules (applied after detection): - If instrument-type == convertible AND numeric_context == price -> map numeric to DebtInstrumentConvertibleConversionPrice1 (convertible conversion/issuance price). - If offering_flag == true AND numeric_context == shares -> map numeric to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues. - If instrument-type == convertible AND offering_flag == true AND numeric_context == shares -> StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (shares issued in offering of convertible instrument). - Only if no instrument-type OR offering cues detected, or if explicit secondary-sale cues present, fall back to SaleOfStockNumberOfSharesIssuedInTransaction / SaleOfStockPricePerShare. Distance weighting: - When multiple cues present, compute score = (instrument_cue_present ? 10 : 0) + (offering_cue_present ? 8 : 0) + (1 / (1 + token_distance_to_numeric)).

cross-sentence span limited to <= 40 tokens and require explicit referential pronoun/anchor.\n- Percentage confirmation: if a percentage token describing composition (e.g., 'constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues') appears in the same sentence and a currency token is also present, use the composition anchor to link the currency amount to customer/contract revenue tag.\n\nPrecedence and tie-breakers (apply in order):\n1) If any of the contract/customer lexical cues match within window -> assign RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (or the most specific contract-customer revenue tag available) to the nearest currency numeric token.\n2) If the sentence contains both a contract/customer cue and a generic 'revenues' cue, prefer the contract/customer tag.\n3) If multiple contract-customer-like tags are possible (e.g., both 'segment revenue' and a narrower 'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax' exist), prefer the most specific taxonomy tag that explicitly mentions 'contract' or 'customer' and/or includes 'excluding assessed tax' when 'excluding' present.\n4) Only fallback to generic Revenues when NO contract/customer cue is present within the association windows and no antecedent resolution links the numeric to a contract/customer anchor.\n\nConflict & ambiguity handling:\n- If both a contract/customer cue and an unrelated revenue-like cue (e.g., 'non-operating revenues') are within window, prefer contract/customer mapping only when token-distance score (1/(1+distance)) + specificity bonus exceeds the other cue's score; otherwise flag as 'revenue-cue-conflict' for human review.\n- If 'reimbursable' appears but no currency numeric within ±8 tokens, flag 'reimbursable-no-amount' for review (do not infer amount from nearby generic 'revenues' tokens across long spans).\n\nLogging & QA:\n- Log every automatic assignment to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax with spans for the lexical cue, numeric token, and any percent-composition token used to confirm mapping.\n- Add 'revenue-specificity-fallback' entries when fallback to generic Revenues occurs despite presence of ambiguous cues, to be included in retraining batches.\n\nUnit-tests / minimal examples to add (atomic):\n1) 'Excluding reimbursable revenues of $39.9 million, ENL constituted approximately 23.6 percent of our total consolidated revenues...' -> $39.9M = RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax; 23.6% = ConcentrationRiskPercentage1.\n2) 'Reimbursable revenues of $12.5 million were billed to the customer under the contract.' -> $12.5M = RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax.\n3) 'Segment revenues from our European customers totaled $45 million.' -> $45M = RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax (segment + customer anchor).\n4) 'Total revenues were $1.2 billion; other operating income was $5 million.' -> $1.2B = Revenues (generic) (no contract/customer cue present).\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Insert this rule prior to any generic 'revenues' -> Revenues lexical fallback.\n- Ensure the regexes and association windows are applied before coarse classifier decisions that prefer generic tags.\n- Capture mapping decisions as structured logs for traceability and to generate counterexamples for retraining when false positives/negatives are found.\n[ctx-00008] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Atomic unit-driven disambiguation: share-count vs monetary-amount mapping (repurchases & issuance contexts)\n- Purpose: when a sentence contains both a shares-count token and a currency token, deterministically map the shares-count numeric to a shares-count tag and the currency numeric to a monetary tag; avoid conflation. \n- Exact lexical/unit cues (case-insensitive regexes): /\\bshare(s)?\\b/, /\\bcommon\\s+share(s)?\\b/, /\\bordinary\\s+share(s)?\\b/, /\\bmillion\\s+shares\\b/, /\\bthousand\\s+shares\\b/.

Repurchase cues: /repurchas(e|ed|ing)|purchas(e|ed|ing)\\s+(back)|repurchase\\s+program|bought\\s+back/i. \n- Association windows: primary window = ±8 tokens around each numeric token to detect unit anchors; sentence-level scan to find both share-unit and currency-unit occurrences. \n- Precedence & decision flow (apply in order): 1) If a numeric token has a nearby share-unit cue -> assign share-count tag appropriate to transaction context (e.g., StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares or StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues if issuance/underwriter cues present). 2) If a different numeric token in same sentence has a nearby currency cue -> assign the monetary variant (e.g., StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodAmount or PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross). 3) If a single numeric token is adjacent to both a share-unit and currency token (ambiguous forms like '1.9 million Common Shares ($381 million)') -> split mapping: assign the numeric with 'shares' unit to shares-count tag; assign the adjacent currency numeric to monetary tag. 4) If classifier suggests mapping a currency numeric to a shares-count tag solely because 'share' appears elsewhere in sentence, override classifier and prefer unit-specific mapping; log override. \n- Tie-breaker: instrument/transaction anchors (repurchase/underwriter/offer) can escalate which shares-tag to choose (repurchase -> StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares; offering/underwriter -> StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues). \n- Unit-tests/examples to add:  - 'The company purchased 1.9 million Common Shares for $381 million under the repurchase program.' -> 1.9M = StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares; $381M = StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodAmount.  - 'We issued 5,000,000 shares at $10 per share in the offering' -> 5,000,000 = StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues; $10 (per share) = IssuancePrice/PricePerShare tag.  - 'Purchased 2 million shares' (no currency) -> 2M = StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares. \n- Logging: record unit spans (share-word span and currency span), numeric-token ids, mapping chosen, and any classifier-vs-rule overrides under 'unit-disambiguation-override'.\n## OTHERS\n[misc-00002] helpful=0 harmful=0 :: Micro decision flow for acquisition-related monetary phrases (apply in order): 1) Search sentence (or immediate surrounding sentence ±1) for the exact phrase variants from the lexical-to-tag mapping. 2) If only one cue matches, assign the corresponding tag. 3) If multiple cues match, choose the cue whose token span is closest to the numeric amount (measure token-distance from numeric token to cue span). 4) If both cues are equidistant or no numeric amount is present, break ties by cue specificity: ('purchase price' > 'cash paid' > 'consideration'). 5) If still ambiguous, prefer PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross when the sentence explicitly mentions payments, cash, or amounts described as 'paid' or 'paid as part of the acquisition'; prefer BusinessCombinationConsiderationTransferred1 only when the text uses 'consideration' or explicitly 'consideration transferred' and describes the composition of consideration (e.g., cash + shares + other instruments). 6) Log ambiguous cases for human review and add the sentence to a short test-suite.\n\n**Reflection:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model saw two amounts described as “revenues … for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 … from Pet Partners.” It applied a specificity rule and mapped them to RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax because there is a customer anchor (“from Pet Partners”) and the phrase contains the word “revenues.” For the two goodwill amounts the model correctly mapped to Goodwill because they are explicitly described as the carrying amount of goodwill at specific dates (balance-sheet amounts).

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Identify context for first two amounts. The sentence states these are amounts included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income ('includes revenues of $1,416,000 and $2,869,000 ... for the three months and nine months ended ...'), i.e., headline income-statement line items. Per the playbook specificity guidance, when amounts are presented as income-statement line items (condensed consolidated statement of income), prefer the generic Revenues tag rather than a contract-specific revenue tag that might be triggered by a named customer. Therefore 1,416,000 -> Revenues; 2,869,000 -> Revenues. Step 2: Identify context for the goodwill amounts. The phrase 'The carrying amount of goodwill was $50,697,000 and $41,573,000 at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively' presents point-in-time carrying amounts for goodwill (balance-sheet amounts with 'at [date]'). Mapping such carrying/balance amounts for goodwill should use the Goodwill tag. Therefore 50,697,000 -> Goodwill; 41,573,000 -> Goodwill.
