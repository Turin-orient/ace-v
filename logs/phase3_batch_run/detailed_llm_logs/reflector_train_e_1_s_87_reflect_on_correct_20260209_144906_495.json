Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"400,000\" in sentence: \"20 Note 10 - Goodwill and other intangible assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows : Other amortizable intangible assets were as follows : Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , was $ 400,000 and $ 600,000 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"600,000\" in sentence: \"20 Note 10 - Goodwill and other intangible assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows : Other amortizable intangible assets were as follows : Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , was $ 400,000 and $ 600,000 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"5.0\" in sentence: \"On March 23 , 2018 , Intermountain filed an application and supporting tariffs incorporating the effects of the decreases in both federal and state income taxes resulting in a decrease in revenues of approximately $ 5.0 million annually .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.8\" in sentence: \"This matter is pending before the MNPUC . MTPSC On September 25 , 2017 , Montana - Dakota filed an application with the MTPSC for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $ 2.8 million annually or approximately 4.1 percent above current rates .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1-2) The amounts $400,000 and $600,000 are explicitly labeled as \\\"Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets ... was $400,000 and $600,000, respectively.\\\" That maps directly to an amortization expense tag for intangible assets -> AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 3) The $5.0 million is described as a decrease in revenues resulting from a regulatory filing/tariff application (annual impact). The most specific tag in the taxonomy for a regulatory requested rate change (increase/decrease) amount for public utilities is PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount, so map $5.0M to that tag. 4) Likewise, the $2.8 million is described as a requested natural gas rate increase filed with the state PSC (annual impact). The specific tag PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount is the best match. No other tags (general Revenues, headline revenue) are as specific given the regulatory application context. \",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00010\",\"ctx-00004\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount,PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each sentence and matched the numeric entity to the most specific US GAAP tag available in the provided taxonomy. For items 1 and 2 the sentence explicitly states \\\"Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets ... was $400,000 and $600,000, respectively.\\\" That is a direct statement of amortization expense for intangible assets, which maps precisely to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. For items 3 and 4 the amounts ($5.0 million and $2.8 million) are described as the annual change in revenues resulting from regulatory tariff filings / requested rate changes filed with public utility commissions. The taxonomy contains a specific tag for requested rate increases or decreases for public utilities: PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount. That is the most specific and appropriate tag rather than a generic Revenues tag. The model applied these mappings directly and returned the four tags in the required order.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings and final answer match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no mistake. The model correctly identified the semantic meaning of each numeric amount and selected the most specific applicable tags from the taxonomy.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) identify the financial concept described by the number in context (expense vs. regulatory requested change vs. revenue), and (2) choose the most specific tag in the taxonomy that directly corresponds to that concept (e.g., AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets for amortization expense; PublicUtilitiesRequestedRateIncreaseDecreaseAmount for a regulatory requested rate impact).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map the textual context (what the number represents) to the most specific taxonomy tag available. Don’t default to broad tags like Revenues when the text describes a specific regulatory requested rate change or a specific expense type such as amortization.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
