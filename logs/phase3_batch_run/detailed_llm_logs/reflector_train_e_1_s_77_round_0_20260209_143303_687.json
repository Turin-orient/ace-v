Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"50\" in sentence: \"We discuss commitments related to this capital lease obligation in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report . Sempra South American Utilities 51 In February 2017 , Luz del Sur publicly offered and sold $ 50 million of corporate bonds at 6.38 percent , maturing in 2023 . INTEREST RATE SWAPS We discuss our fair value interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge cash flows in Note 7 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"6.38\" in sentence: \"We discuss commitments related to this capital lease obligation in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report . Sempra South American Utilities 51 In February 2017 , Luz del Sur publicly offered and sold $ 50 million of corporate bonds at 6.38 percent , maturing in 2023 . INTEREST RATE SWAPS We discuss our fair value interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge cash flows in Note 7 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"297\" in sentence: \"( 3 ) Level 3 instruments include $ 297 million and $ 305 million at September 30 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 , respectively , related to Otay Mesa VIE .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"305\" in sentence: \"( 3 ) Level 3 instruments include $ 297 million and $ 305 million at September 30 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 , respectively , related to Otay Mesa VIE .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric entity to the most specific debt/fair-value tag using issuance and interest-rate heuristics. 1) \\\"$50 million\\\" appears in the clause \\\"publicly offered and sold $50 million of corporate bonds\\\" — issuance of corporate bonds denotes a debt instrument face/issued amount. The best matching tag is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. (Applied offering/issuance heuristic: ph-00006, ctx-00005.) 2) \\\"6.38 percent\\\" directly modifies the corporate bonds as the coupon/interest rate on the bonds (\\\"at 6.38 percent\\\"). With an explicit percent and instrument anchor in the same sentence and 'per annum' style context, the correct tag is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (ctx-00011, ctx-00005). 3) \\\"$297 million\\\" and 4) \\\"$305 million\\\" appear as amounts included in \\\"Level 3 instruments\\\" (fair-value hierarchy) related to a VIE. These are best represented as fair-value measures of debt instruments; the appropriate tag is DebtInstrumentFairValue for each amount. (Mapped Level 3 instrument amounts to instrument fair value.)\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ctx-00011\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentFairValue\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFairValue,DebtInstrumentFairValue\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount,DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Summary: I reviewed each numeric entity in its sentence and compared the model's tag choices to the ground truth. The model correctly identified the $50 issuance amount as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount and the 6.38% as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. For the two VIE amounts ($297 and $305), the model labeled them as DebtInstrumentFairValue because it saw the phrase \\\"Level 3 instruments\\\" (which often relates to fair-value hierarchy). The ground truth, however, maps those amounts to DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. The mapping error arises from interpreting the phrase as an explicit fair-value measurement instead of as reported carrying balances at the dates named.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the $297 and $305 amounts as DebtInstrumentFairValue instead of DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model equated the phrase \\\"Level 3 instruments\\\" with fair-value amounts without validating whether the sentence was reporting fair-value measurements or simply balance sheet carrying amounts reported at specific dates. It relied on a heuristic (Level 3 => fair value) that in this context was not the appropriate mapping for the dataset's label conventions.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Check lexical cues beyond the word \\\"Level 3\\\": look for explicit phrases such as \\\"fair value\\\", \\\"measured at fair value\\\", or \\\"at fair value\\\" to choose DebtInstrumentFairValue. If amounts are presented as balances \\\"at [date]\\\", \\\"at September 30, 2017\\\" or in a note context listing balances related to a VIE, prefer DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. When ambiguous, use the tag that corresponds to reported carrying/balance amounts unless the text explicitly states fair-value measurement.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish 'fair value' vs 'carrying amount' by explicit language: 'fair value', 'measured at', and explicit fair-value hierarchy mentions combined with 'fair value' indicate DebtInstrumentFairValue. Phrases showing balances 'at [date]' or 'include $X at [date]' typically indicate carrying amounts and should map to DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
