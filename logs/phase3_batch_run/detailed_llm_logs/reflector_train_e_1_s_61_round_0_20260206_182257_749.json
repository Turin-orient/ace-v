Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"50,724\" in sentence: \"NOTE 11 - OPERATING LEASES We lease a 50,724 square foot mixed office and warehouse facility in Golden Valley , Minnesota .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"10,165\" in sentence: \"We lease a 10,165 square foot mixed office and warehouse facility in Bloomington , Minnesota .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"19,805\" in sentence: \"We lease a 19,805 square foot mixed office and warehouse facility in Singapore .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"1.3\" in sentence: \"Rent expense was $ 1.3 million in 2017 , $ 1.3 million in 2016 , and $ 1.2 million in 2015 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1-3) Each of the first three numeric tokens (50,724; 10,165; 19,805) is given with the lexical cue 'square foot' (i.e., area of a leased facility). The best US GAAP tag for a numeric area measurement of real estate is AreaOfRealEstateProperty. 4) The phrase 'Rent expense was $1.3 million...' is an explicit rent/lease expense line. In the context of operating leases (NOTE 11 - OPERATING LEASES) the most specific expense tag available is OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet (matches the 'rent expense' lexical cue and operating-lease context).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\",\"ctx-00005\",\"ctx-00011\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,AreaOfRealEstateProperty,LeaseAndRentalExpense\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace: for items 1–3 it correctly matched numeric area measurements with the AreaOfRealEstateProperty tag because each phrase explicitly used the lexical cue 'square foot'. For item 4 the sentence reads: 'Rent expense was $1.3 million in 2017, $1.3 million in 2016, and $1.2 million in 2015.' The model mapped this to OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet because the footnote heading was 'NOTE 11 - OPERATING LEASES' and it inferred an operating-lease-specific expense tag. The ground truth, however, uses LeaseAndRentalExpense. So the only mismatch is the fourth item. The two candidate tags are semantically close: OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet versus LeaseAndRentalExpense. The model favored a more specific tag by using the operating-lease context; the ground truth favored the broader, directly lexical match to 'Rent expense.'\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model selected a too-specific tag (OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet) for the rent expense line instead of the ground-truth, more general tag LeaseAndRentalExpense. It over-relied on the footnote header context ('OPERATING LEASES') rather than the actual wording of the line item ('Rent expense') and the common tag mapping.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is an overapplication of contextual inference and not prioritizing direct lexical matches and canonical line-item mapping. The model conflated 'operating leases' context with the exact tag that should be used for a generic 'rent expense' disclosure. It did not check whether the specific 'OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet' tag is the canonical mapping for a sentence that literally says 'Rent expense,' and instead assumed specificity is better. This reflects a misunderstanding of the tag-selection principle: prefer the tag that best matches the explicit label/term used in the disclosure (and the training/ground-truth conventions), not just the surrounding context.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Map the phrase 'Rent expense' directly to the canonical line-item tag LeaseAndRentalExpense when the text literally uses 'Rent expense' or 'Lease and rental expense.' Only choose OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet if the disclosure explicitly labels the line as operating-lease-specific rent expense in a way that matches that tag's definition (for example, an explicit table or line labeled 'Operating lease rent expense – net'). In practice: 1) first check for exact lexical matches to known line-item tags, 2) only apply a more specific tag if the wording or structure explicitly references that specificity, and 3) when in doubt prefer the broader canonical tag used in training/ground-truth.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When selecting tags, prioritize exact lexical/label matches to the disclosure line item over background context. Specific context can justify a narrower tag only if the text explicitly uses the narrower concept. In ambiguous cases, choose the canonical, more general financial-statement line-item tag (e.g., LeaseAndRentalExpense for 'Rent expense').\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
