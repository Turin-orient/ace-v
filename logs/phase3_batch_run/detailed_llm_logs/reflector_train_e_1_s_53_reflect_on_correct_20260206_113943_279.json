Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"445.0\" in sentence: \"As of February 13 , 2018 , the Partnership had $ 445.0 million outstanding borrowings and approximately $ 1.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"1.1\" in sentence: \"As of February 13 , 2018 , the Partnership had $ 445.0 million outstanding borrowings and approximately $ 1.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"no\" in sentence: \"Issuances of Common Units The Partnership had no common unit issuances for the years ended December 31 , 2017 and 2016 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"3.0\" in sentence: \"In each of 2017 and 2016 , the Partnership funded $ 3.0 million to the Pension Plan and expects to fund an additional $ 3.0 million to the plan in 2018 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) $445.0 million outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility: the sentence explicitly states 'outstanding borrowings' tied to the revolving credit facility. Playbook guidance (ctx-00008, ctx-00025) instructs that 'outstanding' / 'borrowings' should be treated as the facility/instrument outstanding amount (do not map to capacity). No dedicated 'outstanding under facility' tag exists in the provided tag list, so the best-fit tag representing the line-of-credit borrowing is LineOfCredit (maps the facility/instrument amount). 2) $1.1 billion available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility: playbook ctx-00009 and ctx-00025 indicate that explicit 'amount available under the facility' / 'available borrowing capacity' maps to RemainingBorrowingCapacity. Therefore assign LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity. 3) 'no' common unit issuances: this is a negation meaning zero issuances. Err-00002 prescribes normalizing negation to numeric zero for quantity tags. The best tag for 'issuances in the period' is StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (with value = 0). 4) $3.0 million funded to the Pension Plan in each of 2017 and 2016 (and expected in 2018): funding to a pension plan is employer contributions to a benefit plan. Use the employer-contributions tag for pension plans: DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer. Summary of selected tags: Q1 -> LineOfCredit; Q2 -> LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity; Q3 -> StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (zero by negation); Q4 -> DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00008\",\n    \"ctx-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00025\",\n    \"err-00002\",\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"err-00026\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"LineOfCredit,LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nLineOfCredit,LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLineOfCredit,LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the ground truth. For Q1 the sentence refers to borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit facility; the tag LineOfCredit is the best-fit from the provided list to represent the facility-level outstanding borrowings amount. For Q2 the sentence explicitly states available borrowing capacity under the same facility; LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity directly matches that concept. For Q3 the sentence negates any common unit issuances for the periods, which should be normalized to zero for an issuance-count tag; StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues is the issuance-count tag that fits. For Q4 the Partnership funded specified amounts to the Pension Plan; DefinedBenefitPlanContributionsByEmployer maps to employer contributions to a defined benefit plan. The predicted tags match the ground truth exactly, so the mapping decisions and tag selections were correct and consistent with the wording of each sentence.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error identified. The model selected tags that correctly reflect the entities in the sentences and its final answer matches the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no incorrect reasoning to trace back to a conceptual misunderstanding or calculation mistake in this case.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model followed an appropriate approach: (1) identify the financial concept described by the entity in context (outstanding borrowings, available capacity, zero issuances, pension contributions), (2) find the closest matching US GAAP tag from the provided list, and (3) normalize negations to numeric zero when mapping counts. Continue to apply this systematic mapping approach.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When mapping textual financial mentions to US GAAP tags: 1) focus on the specific concept in context (e.g., outstanding amount vs. available capacity), 2) choose the tag that semantically matches that concept at the facility or instrument level, and 3) normalize linguistic negations to explicit numeric values when the tag expects a count or amount.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00008\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00025\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"err-00002\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ph-00006\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"err-00026\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
