Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"625,000\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"5\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"6\" in sentence: \"The Company agreed to acquire the property for a purchase price of $ 875,000 plus closing costs consisting of a seller financing note in the amount of $ 625,000 with the seller carrying the note at 5 % per annum for the first twelve months and then 6 % per annum for the next four years , $ 200,000 in cash , and 50,000 shares of the Company 's common stock valued at $ 50,000 .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"83,750\" in sentence: \"In exchange for $ 75,000 cash net of fees , the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $ 83,750 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric by applying the playbook lexical/instrument heuristics. Q1: \\\"$625,000\\\" is described as \\\"a seller financing note in the amount of $625,000\\\" — lexical cue \\\"note\\\" + phrase \\\"in the amount of\\\" / \\\"principal amount\\\" matches the face/ principal mapping for debt instruments. Per ctx-00008 (aggregate/principal amount -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount) this numeric is best tagged as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. Q2: \\\"5\\\" appears as \\\"5% per annum\\\" tied to the seller financing note. The presence of a percentage with the explicit \\\"per annum\\\" phrase and a debt instrument anchor matches ctx-00011 (per-annum interest on a named debt -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage). Therefore 5% -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Q3: same reasoning as Q2: \\\"6% per annum\\\" on the same seller note -> DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Q4: \\\"$83,750\\\" is the amount of a \\\"convertible promissory note\\\" (instrument anchor = convertible promissory note). This is an instrument face/ principal amount; map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (ctx-00008). I also noted acquisition context/\\\"purchase price\\\" language (ctx-00001) but the individual numeric tokens referencing \\\"note in the amount of\\\" and the \\\"convertible promissory note in the amount of\\\" drove the instrument-face mappings. No spread/LIBOR patterns or other measurement-term conflicts were present that would change these mappings.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00008\", \"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00006\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined each numeric in context and applied standard lexical heuristics for debt instruments. For Q1, \\\"$625,000\\\" is described as \\\"a seller financing note in the amount of $625,000\\\" — the phrase 'note' + 'in the amount of' identifies a debt instrument principal, so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is the correct tag. For Q2, \\\"5% per annum\\\" is an explicit stated interest rate on that seller note; percentages described as 'per annum' for a named debt map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. For Q3, \\\"6% per annum\\\" is the same type of stated interest rate on the same note, so the same tag applies. For Q4, \\\"$83,750\\\" is the stated amount of a \\\"convertible promissory note\\\"; again the instrument anchor and 'in the amount of' phrasing indicate the principal/face amount, so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings from the text to US GAAP tags were correct and matched the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable; the model applied appropriate heuristics (instrument anchor + amount → face amount; percent per annum → stated interest rate) and there was no misinterpretation.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) identify the instrument anchor (e.g., 'note', 'promissory note') and map 'in the amount of' or similar phrasing to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount for principal amounts, and (2) map explicit percentage expressions tied to a debt instrument and described 'per annum' to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Rule of thumb: '...note / promissory note ... in the amount of $X' → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.
