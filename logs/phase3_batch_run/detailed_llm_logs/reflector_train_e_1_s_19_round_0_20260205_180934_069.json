Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each mapping the model made and compared to the ground truth. Questions 2–4 were mapped correctly: 1.1 million aggregate repurchase cost -> TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod (correct); $13.9 million remaining repurchase capacity -> StockRepurchaseProgramRemainingAuthorizedRepurchaseAmount1 (correct); 131,600 RSUs granted -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod (correct). The only mismatch is question 1: the sentence says the company \\\"repurchased 70,783 shares ... at an average price of $15.09,\\\" so the $15.09 is the average cost per share in a repurchase (treasury stock acquisition). I selected SaleOfStockPricePerShare (a tag for price on sale/issuance) instead of TreasuryStockAcquiredAverageCostPerShare (the tag that specifically denotes the average cost per share for repurchased/treasury shares). The rest of the model’s semantic mappings were consistent with the verbs and objects in the text (repurchased -> treasury stock tags, remaining available under repurchase program -> stock repurchase program tag, granted RSUs -> share‑based compensation grants tag).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mapped the per‑share average repurchase price ($15.09) to SaleOfStockPricePerShare instead of TreasuryStockAcquiredAverageCostPerShare. This is a semantic tag-selection error: it confused a repurchase (treasury acquisition) context with a sale/issuance context.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model did not sufficiently use the transaction direction implied by the verb \\\"repurchased.\\\" It appears to have used the presence of a per‑share price to trigger a generic 'price per share' tag (SaleOfStockPricePerShare) without checking whether the price referred to an acquisition (treasury stock) or a sale/issuance. In short, the concept of 'average cost per share in a buyback' was misunderstood or overlooked in favor of a more generic 'price per share' label.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Use the textual cues indicating transaction direction: verbs like 'repurchased', 'acquired', 'bought back', or references to 'treasury stock' should map per‑share prices to treasury‑acquisition tags (TreasuryStockAcquiredAverageCostPerShare or TreasuryStockValueAcquiredCostMethod for totals). Conversely, verbs like 'issued', 'sold', 'proceeds from sale' indicate sale/issuance tags (SaleOfStockPricePerShare). For this example, the correct mapping for $15.09 is TreasuryStockAcquiredAverageCostPerShare because it is explicitly the average price paid in a repurchase. The model should have matched the exact phrasing 'average price' + 'repurchased' to the 'AverageCostPerShare' treasury tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always resolve the transaction direction (repurchase vs issuance) before choosing a per‑share price tag. 'Average price' in a buyback = TreasuryStockAcquiredAverageCostPerShare; price in an issuance/sale = SaleOfStockPricePerShare. Use verbs and surrounding nouns (repurchased/repurchase, treasury stock, issued/sold, proceeds) as decisive signals.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
