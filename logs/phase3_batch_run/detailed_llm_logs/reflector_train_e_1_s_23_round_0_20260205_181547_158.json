Q1: “254,620 performance share awards … granted … under the Company’s … Plan” — explicit grant-language (‘granted … performance share awards’) and numeric within ±8 tokens of grant cue -> map to GrantsInPeriod for equity instruments other than options: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod. Q2: “vest 20% per year …” — percentage describing vesting rights/rate; map percentage to vesting-rights-percentage tag: SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingRightsPercentage. Q3: “The Compensation Committee granted 123,812 performance share awards …” — explicit ‘granted’ phrase with numeric -> same grants-in-period tag as Q1. Q4: “The remaining 130,808 performance share awards have a three-year performance period …” — refers to remaining/unvested awards (the remaining awards that will vest based on performance) -> map to NonvestedNumber for equity instruments other than options: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read the passage and compared the model's chosen tags against the ground truth. The model correctly identified Q1, Q2 and Q3 as share-based compensation grants/vesting tags. The only mismatch was Q4: the model labeled 130,808 as a NonvestedNumber, while the ground truth labels it as GrantsInPeriod. To diagnose, I examined the local discourse: the paragraph first states the Compensation Committee \\\"granted 261,642 RSUs and 254,620 performance share awards\\\" and then explains that the performance share awards consist of two distinct awards: one group (123,812) was granted based on TSR and the \\\"remaining 130,808 performance share awards\\\" have a different (three-year) performance period. Linguistically, \\\"remaining\\\" here is an anaphoric reference to the pool of performance share awards that were granted; it does not mean these awards are intrinsically a different accounting category (e.g., nonvested). The model erred by treating the phrase \\\"remaining ... have a three-year performance period\\\" as indicating a count of nonvested awards rather than as the second tranche of the already-granted awards. The correct interpretation is that both numeric splits (123,812 and 130,808) are parts of the grants described by the Compensation Committee, so both should map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod. The model likely triggered a rule that maps phrases describing vesting/performance periods to nonvested counts; that rule was over-applied without resolving the antecedent \\\"granted\\\" earlier in the paragraph.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified the 130,808 value as NonvestedNumber because it interpreted the clause about a \\\"three-year performance period\\\" as indicating a nonvested grouping, rather than recognizing that \\\"the remaining 130,808 performance share awards\\\" are the second portion of the already-granted awards. In short: failure to resolve the anaphora/antecedent connection to the prior \\\"granted\\\" statement and an overgeneralized rule linking 'performance period' language to nonvested counts.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Two related issues caused the error: (1) anaphora/pronoun resolution deficiency — the model didn't propagate the action 'granted' from the earlier sentence to the phrase 'the remaining 130,808 ...', thereby losing the grant context; (2) an overbroad heuristic that associates language about 'performance period' or future vesting with the NonvestedNumber tag, without checking whether the numeric is part of an explicitly granted award described earlier. The model applied a surface-level lexical rule instead of performing a small-scale discourse analysis to find antecedent verbs and scope.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Resolve antecedents before applying lexical-tagging heuristics. Specifically: (a) detect that the paragraph establishes a single grant event ('granted 261,642 RSUs and 254,620 performance share awards'); (b) parse subsequent sentences for partitions of that granted pool (e.g., 'granted 123,812 ... The remaining 130,808 ...') and treat those numeric values as components of the original grant event; (c) prefer the GrantsInPeriod tag for numerics that are part of or described in immediate continuation of a 'granted' clause, unless explicit language indicates a different status (e.g., 'nonvested as of', 'outstanding', 'vested during period', 'awards outstanding at period end'). For this example, tag Q4 as ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When tagging counts in multi-sentence award descriptions, perform simple anaphora resolution: numeric mentions introduced as 'remaining', 'the balance', 'the rest' typically refer back to an already-declared grant — so inherit the grant classification. Avoid applying rigid lexical mappings (e.g., 'performance period' -> nonvested) without checking sentence-level antecedents.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ctx-00010\",\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ctx-00001\",\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
