Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"2.34\" in sentence: \"As of March 31 , 2018 , total unrecognized compensation cost related to non - vested stock options granted to employees and officers was $ 13.6 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted - average period of 2.34 years . Restricted Stock and Stock Units The following summarizes the Company ’ s activity in its restricted stock awards and stock units , which include restricted stock units , deferred stock units , and performance stock units , for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 : The Company grants restricted stock awards and deferred stock units to its directors , restricted stock units to its employees and officers , and performance stock units to its officers .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"3.2\" in sentence: \"The Company recognized $ 3.2 million and $ 2.9 million of share - based compensation related to the vesting of restricted stock awards , and stock units during the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's tag choices to the ground truth and to the textual cues in each sentence. The model systematically favored award-level or grant-level tags (award vesting period; fair value of equity instruments vested in period) for all share-based compensation amounts. I inspected the language: \\\"total unrecognized compensation cost ... expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.34 years\\\" points to a period-for-recognition attribute tied to the aggregate unrecognized cost of nonvested awards, not an award-level \\\"award vesting period\\\" tag. The sentence \\\"The Company recognized $3.2 million ... of share-based compensation ... during the three months ended March 31, 2018\\\" describes an expense recognized in the period; the correct mapping is to an allocated share-based compensation expense tag, not to the total fair value of awards vested in the period. The model correctly identified the 23.2 million as total unrecognized compensation cost, which matches the ground truth final tag. So the mistakes are: (a) confusing 'weighted-average period of recognition for aggregate unrecognized cost' with 'award vesting period', and (b) confusing 'recognized $X of share-based compensation' (expense recognized/allocated) with 'fair value of equity instruments vested'.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"1) For 2.34 years the model used an award-level vesting-period tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangement...AwardVestingPeriod1) instead of the aggregate nonvested awards 'period for recognition' tag (EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognizedPeriodForRecognition1). 2) For the $3.2M and $2.9M amounts the model used a 'vested-in-period total fair value' tag instead of the AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense tag (the amounts are amounts of expense recognized/allocated in the period). 3) The model repeated the same mistaken tag for both amounts rather than mapping the sentence's \\\"recognized\\\" language to 'allocated expense' for each period.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model applied an overly broad heuristic: it mapped any share-based compensation numeric to award/grant-level metrics (vesting period, vested-in-period fair value) without attending to the specific action words and aggregation level in the sentence. Key misunderstandings: (a) mixing up 'vesting period' (a property of a grant) with 'period for recognition' of aggregate unrecognized compensation cost; (b) treating 'recognized $X of share-based compensation' as equivalent to 'fair value of awards vested' rather than as the accounting 'allocated expense' recognized in the period. Essentially, the model conflated vocabulary domains (grant attributes vs. expense recognition) and selected the most specific-sounding tag rather than the semantically correct one.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Use the verb and the noun phrase to decide tag granularity and type: - If the text gives an amount described as \\\"total unrecognized compensation cost ... expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of X years\\\", choose the aggregate nonvested awards' 'period for recognition' tag (EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognizedPeriodForRecognition1). - If the text says the company \\\"recognized $X ... of share-based compensation\\\" or \\\"the Company recognized $X ... during the period\\\", map to AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense (the amount of expense recognized/allocated in the period). - If the sentence gives the \\\"total unrecognized compensation cost\\\" dollar amount, map to the aggregate total compensation cost not yet recognized tag. - Distinguish award-level attributes (award vesting periods, grant fair values) from aggregate accounting measures (allocated expense, total unrecognized cost, period-for-recognition) by checking for words like \\\"total\\\", \\\"unrecognized\\\", \\\"expected to be recognized\\\", \\\"recognized\\\", \\\"during the period\\\". Applying these rules yields the ground truth mapping: (1) period-for-recognition tag for 2.34, (2) AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense for 3.2, (3) AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense for 2.9, (4) EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized for 23.2.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map syntactic cues to semantic categories: 'recognized' (when referring to $ amounts in a period) -> expense/allocated tags; 'total unrecognized compensation cost' -> aggregate nonvested awards cost tag; 'expected to be recognized over X years' -> period-for-recognition (aggregate) tag. Do not default to award/grant-level tags just because the topic is share-based compensation—first determine whether the sentence is about award attributes or aggregate accounting measures.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
