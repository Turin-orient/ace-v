Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"3.1\" in sentence: \"INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following table provides information about our intangible assets ( in thousands , except years ) : Amortization expense for the three and six months ended September 30 , 2018 was $ 1.6 million and $ 3.1 million , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"1.8\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense for the three and six months ended September 30 , 2017 , was $ 1.8 million and $ 3.5 million , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"3.5\" in sentence: \"Amortization expense for the three and six months ended September 30 , 2017 , was $ 1.8 million and $ 3.5 million , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"915,931\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , 915,931 shares were available for issuance under the 2015 Plan .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1-3) Each of the amounts ($3.1, $1.8, $3.5 million) are explicitly described as \\\"Amortization expense\\\" in a table of intangible assets. Per the amortization-intangible heuristic (require both amortization cue + 'intangible asset' anchor in the sentence), these map to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 4) \\\"915,931 shares were available for issuance under the 2015 Plan\\\" contains a plan-anchor and availability wording ('available for issuance under the 2015 Plan'); per the plan/availability rules this maps to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00001\", \"ctx-00007\", \"ctx-SBC-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read each sentence and matched the explicit labels and anchors to the US GAAP tag list. Sentences 1–3 explicitly state \\\"Amortization expense\\\" in the context of intangible assets, so the correct mapping is AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets (requires both amortization cue and intangible-asset anchor). Sentence 4 explicitly states \\\"915,931 shares were available for issuance under the 2015 Plan,\\\" which is a direct match for the share-based compensation concept of number of shares available for grant under a plan, so the correct tag is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. No numerical conversions or ambiguity resolution were required beyond recognizing the anchors and mapping to the canonical tags.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mapping and final answers match the ground truth exactly.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because there was no incorrect reasoning. A potential minor risk (not realized here) would be failing to require the \\\"intangible asset\\\" anchor when seeing the word \\\"amortization,\\\" which could mislabel amortization of non-intangible items. That risk did not materialize in these sentences because the context explicitly referenced intangible assets.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) identify the accounting concept cue words (e.g., \\\"amortization expense,\\\" \\\"available for issuance\\\"), (2) confirm the contextual anchor (e.g., \\\"intangible assets,\\\" \\\"2015 Plan\\\"), and (3) select the precise canonical tag that combines the cue and anchor. For ambiguous cases, verify whether the sentence refers to amortization of intangible assets specifically or to another amortization type before choosing AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map by pairing explicit accounting-cue phrases with clear contextual anchors: \\\"amortization expense\\\" + \\\"intangible assets\\\" → AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets; \\\"available for issuance under [Plan]\\\" → ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. Always require both the cue and the relevant anchor to avoid overgeneralization.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
