Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"703,000\" in sentence: \"Stockholders ’ Equity Treasury Stock In the first quarter of 2017 , the Company paid $ 14,402,000 for repurchases of its common stock ; and of that amount , 703,000 shares of its common stock were repurchased in private transactions for an aggregate cost of $ 13,975,000 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"10\" in sentence: \"A ) IHC Share - Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of IHC ’ s share - based compensation plans : ( i ) the exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and the terms of an option may not exceed 10 years from the grant date ; and ( ii ) the exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and SAR terms may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"10\" in sentence: \"A ) IHC Share - Based Compensation Plans Under the terms of IHC ’ s share - based compensation plans : ( i ) the exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and the terms of an option may not exceed 10 years from the grant date ; and ( ii ) the exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the fair market value of an IHC share on the grant date and SAR terms may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"1,133,100\" in sentence: \"At March 31 , 2017 , there were 1,133,100 shares available for future stock - based compensation grants under IHC ’ s stock incentive plan .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I applied the playbook heuristics and unit-and-anchor validation to each numeric token.\\n\\n1) 703,000 shares repurchased: sentence contains explicit repurchase language ('repurchased', 'repurchases', 'aggregate cost', 'private transactions') and a share-count numeric. Per repurchase mapping (ctx-00011) and unit-anchor validation (ctx-00010) share counts near repurchase cues map to a repurchased-shares tag. The best match in the provided taxonomy is StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares (ties with treasury-stock tags resolved in favor of the explicit 'repurchased during period' tag).\\n\\n2) '10' (option term in years): the numeric is a period (years) describing maximum option term ('may not exceed 10 years from the grant date'). This maps to the expiration/term of awards. Using share-based-compensation period rules (ctx-00006) and unit validation (ctx-00010) the appropriate tag is SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod.\\n\\n3) Second '10' (SAR term): identical semantics to Q2 (maximum term of SARs expressed in years), same mapping and tag: SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod.\\n\\n4) 1,133,100 shares available for future grants: explicit plan-anchor ('stock incentive plan') and availability cue ('available for future stock-based compensation grants') map to the plan-specific 'shares available for grant' tag per equity/plan rules (ctx-00001) and plan-availability mapping. Unit-and-anchor validation (ctx-00010) confirms a SHARES_COUNT unit and plan anchor. Best tag: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant.\\n\\nI validated unit matches (SHARES_COUNT for share counts, YEARS for expiration period) and required anchors (repurchase/plan/term language) before selecting tags, per ctx-00010.\\n\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00010\",\n    \"ctx-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00014\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nStockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nTreasuryStockSharesAcquired,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I walked through the model's choices and compared them to the ground truth to find the single mismatch (Q1). For Q1 the model saw the phrase '703,000 shares ... were repurchased in private transactions for an aggregate cost of $13,975,000' and the surrounding header 'Stockholders’ Equity Treasury Stock'. The model applied its repurchase-mapping heuristic and unit-anchor validation and picked StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares. For Q2 and Q3 it correctly mapped 'may not exceed 10 years' to an award-expiration-period tag. For Q4 it correctly mapped '1,133,100 shares available for future stock-based compensation grants' to the 'shares available for grant' tag.\\n\\nComparing the single incorrect prediction to the ground truth shows the error is a tag-choice granularity/anchor priority problem: although the sentence describes repurchases, the section header and phrasing indicate these are treasury shares acquired. The ground-truth tag TreasuryStockSharesAcquired is more specific and appropriate for a sentence that sits under a 'Treasury Stock' heading and describes shares acquired; StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares is a different, often program-level repurchase disclosure tag. The model did not prioritize the document/section anchor ('Treasury Stock') and chose a semantically overlapping but less specific tag based solely on the verb 'repurchased'.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model selected StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares instead of TreasuryStockSharesAcquired for Q1. It over-relied on the verb 'repurchased' and a generic repurchase mapping, and under-weighted the stronger anchor: the section heading and noun phrase 'Treasury Stock' indicating treasury-share acquisition context.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual confusion about tag granularity and anchor precedence caused the error. The model's playbook mapping for 'repurchased' was too dominant and lacked a rule that gives precedence to explicit section headings or noun-phrase anchors like 'Treasury Stock'. In other words, the model treated 'repurchased' as the primary cue and failed to apply a higher-priority heuristic: when 'treasury' appears (especially in the section header), prefer treasury-specific tags.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Apply anchor-priority rules before selecting among semantically similar tags. Specifically: (1) detect the section-level anchor or noun phrase 'Treasury Stock' and mark 'treasury' context as high priority; (2) when a share-count is described inside a treasury-stock context and the sentence states shares were acquired/repurchased, choose TreasuryStockSharesAcquired; (3) reserve StockRepurchasedDuringPeriodShares for repurchase disclosures that are program-level totals or where no treasury-section anchor exists. Also keep unit-and-anchor validation as a secondary check, not the primary tiebreaker.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Prioritize document/section anchors (like 'Treasury Stock') over local verbs when disambiguating overlapping tags. When two tags are semantically close, prefer the one whose scope matches the section-level anchor (treasury-specific tag in a treasury-stock section).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00006\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00014\", \"tag\": \"neutral\"}\n  ]\n}",
