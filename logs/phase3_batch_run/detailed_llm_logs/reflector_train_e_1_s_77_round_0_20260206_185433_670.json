Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1.

Per issuance/aggregate-principal heuristics (ph-00006, ctx-00005), map currency issuance amounts to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. 2) 'at 6.38 percent' directly qualifies the bonds' stated interest rate in the same sentence. Per the percent-with-instrument-anchor rule (ctx-00004 / ctx-00011), assign DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 3) & 4) 'Level 3 instruments include $297 million and $305 million ... related to Otay Mesa VIE.' Level 3 refers to fair-value-measured investments; given the VIE/investment context and available taxonomy, the best matching tag for these currency investment amounts is EquityMethodInvestments (ctx-00009).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ctx-00004\",\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"ctx-00009\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,EquityMethodInvestments,EquityMethodInvestments\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,EquityMethodInvestments,EquityMethodInvestments\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount,DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's chain of thought and the ground truth. The model correctly mapped the $50 issuance to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount and the 6.38% to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. The error occurs on the two Level 3 amounts ($297 and $305). The model read the phrase \\\"Level 3 instruments include $297 million and $305 million ... related to Otay Mesa VIE\\\" and applied a generic mapping of currency amounts tied to \\\"instruments\\\" or \\\"investments\\\" to the taxonomy tag EquityMethodInvestments. That mapping ignored more specific lexical and accounting cues. In filings, \\\"Level 3 instruments\\\" means items measured at Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy but those items can be debt instruments (notes, bonds) or other financial instruments; the phrase \\\"related to Otay Mesa VIE\\\" suggests these are amounts tied to a financing vehicle (often debt), not necessarily equity-method investments. The ground truth chooses DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount, which corresponds to balances of debt instruments on the books. The model used a broad heuristic (currency + instrument → EquityMethodInvestments) instead of preferring tags that explicitly reference \\\"DebtInstrument\\\" when context implies debt-related financing or a VIE. In short: correct identification of anchors (\\\"bond\\\", \\\"debt\\\", \\\"VIE\\\", \\\"carrying amount\\\" vs \\\"investment\\\") was not performed, causing an incorrect tag selection for Q3 and Q4.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified the two Level 3 amounts ($297 and $305) as EquityMethodInvestments instead of DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount. It applied an overly broad heuristic that currency amounts tied to the word \\\"instruments\\\" or an investment-sounding context should map to equity-investment tags, rather than checking for debt-specific indicators and choosing a DebtInstrument tag.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a conceptual/heuristic misapplication: the model favored a generic 'currency amount → investment' mapping and did not sufficiently weigh the specific lexical anchors and accounting semantics present (\\\"Level 3 instruments\\\", \\\"VIE\\\", typical association of VIE with financing/debt). It also failed to distinguish between tags for (a) issuance principal (DebtInstrumentFaceAmount), (b) outstanding book balance/carrying value (DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount), and (c) fair-value measurement labeling. The model's tag choice arose from insufficiently granular disambiguation rules and an over-reliance on a single surface-level cue (\\\"instruments\\\"/\\\"investments\\\").\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1) Identify the noun anchor and accounting role: here \\\"instruments\\\" + \\\"VIE\\\" signals financial instruments tied to a variable interest entity—often debt-related. 2) Determine whether the amount describes issuance principal, carrying balance, or fair value. The sentence lists existing balances at two dates (Sept 30, 2017 and Dec 31, 2016), so these are balances (carrying amounts), not an issuance face amount. 3) Prefer tags with explicit lexical overlap and accounting match: choose DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount for amounts that represent recorded carrying values of debt instruments. 4) Use surrounding context (mentions of VIE, Level 3 classification, location in the note) to disambiguate between equity investments and debt instruments. 5) Reserve EquityMethodInvestments for clear cases where the text explicitly states \\\"equity-method investment\\\" or names investee ownership/EquityMethod context.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When mapping monetary amounts to taxonomy tags, prioritize (in order): specific lexical anchors (\\\"debt\\\", \\\"bond\\\", \\\"note\\\", \\\"carrying\\\", \\\"face amount\\\"), grammatical role (issuance vs. balance), and surrounding accounting context (VIE, Level 3, note references). Distinguish face amount (issuance principal) from carrying amount (book balance) and from fair-value disclosures, and pick the tag whose label most closely matches those dimensions.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ph-00006\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00005\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00004\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}",
