This is an interest-rate percent associated with a named debt instrument. Per instrument-anchor heuristics and the interest-rate mapping rule, a percentage tied to a named debt instrument should be mapped to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. (Apply instrument-type detection and 'per‑annum'/instrument mapping logic: instrument anchor + percent -> interest-rate tag.)\\n2) Q2: Numeric token = 500 (stated as '€ 500 million aggregate principal amount') uses the lexical phrase 'aggregate principal amount' which denotes the face/nominal amount of the debt issuance. Map such principal/aggregate amounts to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\\n3) Q3: Numeric token = 3.250% likewise is an interest coupon percentage tied to 'Senior Notes' in the sentence; by the same instrument-anchor + percent rule, map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.\\n4) Q4: Numeric token = 500 (stated as '$ 500 million aggregate principal amount') is the aggregate principal/face amount of the Senior Notes due 2026; map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\\nAll mappings follow the playbook heuristics: detect instrument-anchor (Senior Notes), detect percent vs currency/aggregate-principal lexical cues, prefer instrument-specific interest-rate tag for percents and face-amount tag for aggregate principal amounts.\\nNo ambiguous cues (e.g., LIBOR/spread or 'per share' or warrants) are present that would override these mappings, so assignments are straightforward.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"misc-00002\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's step-by-step mapping of the four numeric entities to US GAAP tags. The sentences each describe debt issuances (Senior Notes) and include: an interest/coupon percentage (2.250% and 3.250%) and aggregate principal amounts (€500 million and $500 million). The model used the instrument-anchor heuristic: when a percentage directly qualifies a debt instrument's coupon, the correct tag is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. When a currency amount is labeled as an 'aggregate principal amount', the correct tag is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. The model applied these rules consistently to all four items and produced: DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, DebtInstrumentFaceAmount, DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, DebtInstrumentFaceAmount, which matches the ground truth. I checked for possible ambiguities (e.g., spread vs stated rate, face amount vs fair value) and found none — the wording unambiguously indicated stated coupon rates and aggregate principal (face) amounts.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No substantive error: the model's reasoning and final mappings are correct and match the ground truth. There were no misclassifications, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies in this instance.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — since the prediction is correct there is no root cause of an error to analyze. One minor observation: the model relied on simple heuristics (instrument anchor + lexical cues). These heuristics were appropriate here because the language was unambiguous.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model's approach was correct. For similar cases, continue to (1) detect the instrument anchor (e.g., 'Senior Notes'), (2) interpret percent values adjacent to debt instruments as stated interest rates and map them to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, and (3) interpret 'aggregate principal amount' or similar phrasing with a currency as the debt's face amount and map to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. If wording is ambiguous (e.g., 'spread', 'basis points', 'fair value', or 'carrying amount'), apply additional disambiguation rules.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Rule to remember: percentages immediately qualifying a named debt instrument → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage; currency amounts described as 'principal', 'aggregate principal', or 'face amount' → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.
