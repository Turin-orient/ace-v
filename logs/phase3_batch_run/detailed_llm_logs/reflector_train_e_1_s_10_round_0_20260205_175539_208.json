Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"13.3\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 13.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"0.8\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 13.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"71,000\" in sentence: \"A summary of the Company ’ s RSU activity , including service - based awards and performance - based awards , for the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , is as follows ( share numbers in thousands ) : 17 Table of Contents SHUTTERFLY , INC . NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Included in the RSU grants for the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , are approximately 71,000 RSUs that have both performance criteria tied to the Company ’ s 2020 financial performance and a three - year service criteria .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"83.6\" in sentence: \"At September 30 , 2018 , the Company had $ 83.6 million of total unrecognized stock - based compensation expense , net of estimated forfeitures , related to stock options , RSUs and PBRS Us that will be recognized over a weighted - average period of approximately two years .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric to the most specific share-based-compensation tag using lexical cues in the sentences and the playbook's equity/plan and share-based-compensation heuristics.\\n1) “The total intrinsic value of options exercised … was $13.3 million …” — lexical cue “intrinsic value of options exercised” directly corresponds to the taxonomy element that captures total intrinsic value of option exercises in the period. Therefore the best tag is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue. (Applied rule: map explicit “intrinsic value” + “options exercised” to options-exercises intrinsic-value tag.)\\n2) Same sentence for 2017 amount $0.8 million — same lexical cue, same tag: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue.\\n3) “Approximately 71,000 RSUs … that have both performance criteria … and a three-year service criteria” — this is a count of equity instruments other than options (RSUs) that are nonvested (performance + service vesting). Best tag: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber. (Applied rule: when text reports number of nonvested RSUs, map to nonvested-number for equity instruments other than options.)\\n4) “The Company had $83.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense … that will be recognized over a weighted-average period …” — lexical cue “total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense” maps to the nonvested awards’ total compensation cost not yet recognized. Best tag: EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized.\\nI avoided generic tags and selected the most specific share-based-compensation taxonomy elements. No ambiguity requiring human review was found (explicit cues present).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\",\"ph-00006\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and compared each predicted tag to the ground truth. The model correctly identified the tags for items 1, 2 and 4 by matching explicit lexical cues: \\\"intrinsic value of options exercised\\\" -> OptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue (items 1 & 2), and \\\"total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense\\\" -> NonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized (item 4). The only mismatch is item 3. The sentence reads: \\\"Included in the RSU grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, are approximately 71,000 RSUs that have both performance criteria tied to the Company’s 2020 financial performance and a three-year service criteria.\\\" The phrase \\\"included in the RSU grants for the nine months ended ... are approximately 71,000 RSUs\\\" is a direct statement that 71,000 RSUs are part of the grants issued during that reporting period. That lexical framing (\\\"grants for the ... ended\\\" / \\\"included in the RSU grants\\\") maps to a GrantsInPeriod tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod). The model instead selected the NonvestedNumber tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber), which would be correct only if the sentence explicitly described nonvested awards or outstanding unvested balances. Here the text describes grants issued during the period and merely notes their vesting/performance conditions, not that they are \\\"nonvested awards\\\" or an outstanding nonvested count.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified the 71,000 figure as the number of nonvested RSUs rather than the number of RSUs granted in the period. It inferred 'nonvested' from the mention of vesting/performance criteria instead of using the explicit phrase 'RSU grants for the nine months ended ... are approximately 71,000 RSUs', which indicates 'grants in period'.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model over-relied on semantic inference (seeing vesting conditions and assuming 'nonvested') instead of prioritizing explicit lexical cues that indicate the statistic's type. It conflated 'awards with vesting/performance criteria' with a count of nonvested outstanding awards, failing to distinguish between 'grants in period' and 'nonvested outstanding' concepts.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Map based on the immediate lexical and syntactic cues: when the text explicitly refers to 'grants for the [period]' or 'granted during [period]', use the GrantsInPeriod tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod). Reserve the NonvestedNumber tag only for explicit phrases like 'nonvested awards', 'unvested', 'awards outstanding and unvested', or where the context clearly indicates outstanding/unvested balances rather than grants made in the period. In practice: (a) check for tokens: 'grants', 'granted', 'awarded', 'for the [period]', (b) if present map to GrantsInPeriod; (c) otherwise look for 'nonvested', 'unvested', 'outstanding' to map to NonvestedNumber.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Prefer exact lexical matches over inferred semantic relations. 'Grants in period' will be signaled by language like 'grants for the [period]' or 'granted during', whereas 'nonvested number' must be signaled explicitly (e.g., 'nonvested', 'unvested', 'awards outstanding and unvested'). Do not infer nonvested status from mention of vesting conditions alone.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
