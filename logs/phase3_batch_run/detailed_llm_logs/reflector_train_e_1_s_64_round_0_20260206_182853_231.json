Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"1.70\" in sentence: \"For a period of 180 days following the third amendment to the revolving credit facility that occurred in May 2018 , we paid interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.70 % .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"1.38\" in sentence: \"Effective October 2018 , we resumed paying interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.38 % for a total of 3.89 % .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"2.51\" in sentence: \"One month LIBOR at December 26 , 2018 was approximately 2.51 % .5.00 % Notes In September 2016 , we completed the private offering of $ 350.0 million of our 5.00 % senior notes due October 2024 ( the “ 2024 Notes ” ) .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"5.00\" in sentence: \"One month LIBOR at December 26 , 2018 was approximately 2.51 % .5.00 % Notes In September 2016 , we completed the private offering of $ 350.0 million of our 5.00 % senior notes due October 2024 ( the “ 2024 Notes ” ) .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I applied the playbook rules for mapping percentage amounts in debt/interest contexts. Step 1 (Q1): The phrase 'LIBOR plus 1.70%' is the canonical 'LIBOR plus X%' pattern. Per the LIBOR-plus heuristic, the X (1.70%) is a variable-rate margin/spread and should be mapped to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. Step 2 (Q2): Similarly, 'LIBOR plus 1.38%' isolates the spread component 1.38%; map to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. Step 3 (Q3): 'One month LIBOR ... was approximately 2.51%' reports the index level itself (LIBOR at 2.51%). There is no instrument anchor for a stated coupon; the best fit among available tags for a percentage directly qualifying a rate is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (used for percent rates tied to debt/index levels when no spread phrase is present). Step 4 (Q4): '5.00% senior notes' is an explicit stated coupon on a named debt instrument (the 5.00% Notes); per the interest-rate mapping, map 5.00% to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. I prioritized the explicit 'LIBOR plus' spread rule for Q1/Q2 and instrument-interest rule for Q4; for Q3 I selected the stated-rate tag as the closest available taxonomy match for a reported LIBOR index level.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00003\", \"ctx-00011\", \"ph-00006\", \"ctx-00004\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each question and the model's mappings against the ground truth. Q1 and Q2: the model tagged both 'LIBOR plus 1.70%' and 'LIBOR plus 1.38%' as DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. Those align with the ground truth — these percentages are clearly spread/margin values added to a benchmark and should be mapped to a basis-spread tag. Q4: the model tagged '5.00% senior notes' as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, which matches the ground truth — that is an explicit stated coupon on a debt instrument. Q3 is the mismatch. The model labeled 'One month LIBOR ... was approximately 2.51%' as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage (a fixed stated coupon tag). The ground truth labels that entity as DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. I examined context: the text explicitly names the LIBOR index and its level ('One month LIBOR ... was approximately 2.51%'). Although 2.51% is an index level rather than a named instrument coupon, the ground truth expects LIBOR-related numeric values to be captured by the variable-rate basis tag. The model conflated an index level with an instrument's stated interest rate and therefore applied the stated-rate tag instead of the basis-spread tag.\\n\\nI verified that the error is isolated to the treatment of LIBOR/index percentage values and not to the mapping of explicit spreads ('plus X%') or fixed coupons ('5.00% senior notes').\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified the LIBOR index value (2.51%) as a DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage rather than DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. In short, it treated an index-level percentage as a fixed stated coupon.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model applied an overly narrow heuristic: it reserved DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage for any percent-number in a financial sentence that 'looks like' an interest rate, instead of distinguishing between fixed stated coupons and benchmark/index values or spreads. It failed to consistently apply the rule that numbers tied to benchmark rates (e.g., LIBOR) or variable-rate contexts should be mapped to the basis-spread/variable-rate tag. The conceptual misunderstanding is conflating 'interest rate on a specific debt instrument' with 'benchmark/index level or spread used to compute variable interest'.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Adopt a clear precedence and contextual ruleset: (1) If the numeric is explicitly described as a 'plus' margin (e.g., 'LIBOR plus X%'), map X to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1. (2) If the numeric is an index/benchmark level (contains 'LIBOR', 'one-month LIBOR', 'at [date]', 'was approximately'), map it to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1 per the playbook/ground-truth expectation. (3) Only map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage when the percentage is explicitly the stated coupon or contractual interest rate of a debt instrument (e.g., '5.00% senior notes', 'stated interest rate of X% on the notes'). Apply simple pattern checks for keywords around the number — 'LIBOR', 'one-month', 'three-month', 'at [date]', 'was approximately' signal a benchmark/index; 'plus', 'spread', 'margin' signal a spread; instrument names such as 'notes', 'senior notes', 'coupon' signal a stated rate.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Differentiate benchmark/index values and spreads from fixed stated coupons using local lexical cues. Rule of thumb: numeric values tied to named benchmarks like LIBOR map to basis/spread tags; numeric values explicitly tied to a debt instrument (coupon/labeled percent on notes/bonds) map to interest-rate-stated tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
