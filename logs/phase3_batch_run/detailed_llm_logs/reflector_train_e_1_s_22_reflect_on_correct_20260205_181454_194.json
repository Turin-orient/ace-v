Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"50.0\" in sentence: \"The maturity date for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility is October 31 , 2022 . With respect to the revolving credit facility , the entire amount available may be used by Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in U.S. dollars and certain alternative currencies , up to $ 600.0 million may be used by certain subsidiaries of Quanta for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies , up to $ 100.0 million may be used for swing line loans in U.S. dollars , up to $ 50.0 million may be used for swing line loans in Canadian dollars and up to $ 30.0 million ( increased to $ 50.0 million pursuant to the October 2018 amendment ) may be used for swing line loans in Australian dollars .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"449.9\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"242.3\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"207.6\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 , Quanta had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility , $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million of which were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , primarily Canadian and Australian dollars .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Apply credit-facility mapping heuristics. 1) The phrase 'up to $50.0 million may be used for swing line loans in Canadian dollars' contains the 'up to' maximum/commitment cue tied to the credit facility and a specific usage bucket (swing line). Playbook ctx-00015 and ctx-00009 state that 'up to'/'in an aggregate principal amount of' language indicates a maximum/commitment amount (LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity) rather than a point-in-time remaining amount. Therefore 50.0 -> LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity. 2) The sentence 'As of September 30, 2018, Quanta had $449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under the credit facility' uses the exact lexical cue 'outstanding letters of credit' and is a point-in-time outstanding amount. Playbook ctx-00009 example maps such amounts to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. Therefore 449.9 -> LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. 3) The $242.3 million phrase is a currency breakdown of the outstanding letters of credit denominated in U.S. dollars (a component of the outstanding letters of credit total). There is no more specific tag for currency breakdowns of letters, so by the same heuristic (letters outstanding anchor) it maps to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. 4) Similarly $207.6 million (denominated in other currencies) is the remaining component of the outstanding letters and maps to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. Unit/anchor validation: all are currency amounts with explicit anchors ('up to', 'outstanding letters of credit') so the assignments pass the unit-and-anchor checks (ctx-00010).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00015\", \"ctx-00009\", \"ctx-00010\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount,LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the sentences. For Q1 the phrase 'up to $ 50.0 million' is a clear maximum/commitment indicator tied to the credit facility's borrowing buckets; the correct mapping is a facility maximum/commitment tag (LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity). For Q2–Q4 the sentence explicitly states 'had $ 449.9 million of outstanding letters of credit ... $ 242.3 million of which were denominated in U.S. dollars and $ 207.6 million ... in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.' The lexical anchor 'outstanding letters of credit' clearly points to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount; the two currency breakouts are components of that outstanding amount and there is no more specific currency-breakdown tag in the provided list, so mapping each component to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount is appropriate. The model also applied unit-and-anchor validation (currency unit + 'up to' / 'outstanding' anchors) which is consistent with standard XBRL tagging heuristics.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"There is no functional error: the predicted tags match the ground truth. The reasoning used correct lexical anchors ('up to', 'outstanding') and applied appropriate mapping heuristics.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"N/A for correctness — the model correctly identified anchors and selected the appropriate tags. One minor risk area is a habitual tendency to collapse all component amounts to the same parent tag even when a more granular tag could exist; in this case, no more granular tag was available, so that behavior did not produce an error.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should continue to (1) identify lexical anchors ('up to' => maximum/commitment; 'outstanding' => outstanding amount), (2) choose the tag that directly corresponds to that anchor (LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity for a borrowing cap; LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount for outstanding letters of credit), and (3) validate that the numeric unit and contextual phrasing match the selected tag. If a sentence gives component breakdowns (currency or segment), map to a component tag only if a specific component tag exists; otherwise map to the same parent/outstanding tag.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map lexical anchors to tag types: 'up to' and similar cap/commitment language => facility maximum/borrowing-capacity tags; 'outstanding' => outstanding amount tags. When encountering component breakdowns, prefer a more specific component tag if available; otherwise map components back to the parent monetary tag. Always validate anchor + numeric unit before finalizing a tag.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00015\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
