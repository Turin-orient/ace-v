Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"13.3\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 13.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"0.8\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 13.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"71,000\" in sentence: \"A summary of the Company ’ s RSU activity , including service - based awards and performance - based awards , for the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , is as follows ( share numbers in thousands ) : 17 Table of Contents SHUTTERFLY , INC . NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Included in the RSU grants for the nine months ended September 30 , 2018 , are approximately 71,000 RSUs that have both performance criteria tied to the Company ’ s 2020 financial performance and a three - year service criteria .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"83.6\" in sentence: \"At September 30 , 2018 , the Company had $ 83.6 million of total unrecognized stock - based compensation expense , net of estimated forfeitures , related to stock options , RSUs and PBRS Us that will be recognized over a weighted - average period of approximately two years .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric entity using the share-based-compensation lexical anchors and plan/nonvested rules in the playbook (ctx-00001). 1–2) The phrase \\\"total intrinsic value of options exercised ... was $13.3 million and $0.8 million\\\" explicitly references option exercises and their intrinsic value; the precise taxonomy element for that fact is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue. Both 13.3 and 0.8 are intrinsic values for option exercises, so both map to that same tag. 3) The sentence describes approximately 71,000 RSUs that are performance- and service-vesting (nonvested equity instruments other than options). The most specific tag is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber. 4) The sentence states \\\"$83.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense ... that will be recognized over a weighted-average period ...\\\" — this corresponds to unrecognized compensation cost for nonvested awards: EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized. I selected the most specific share-based-compensation tags consistent with the playbook guidance (use plan/award-specific tags and nonvested/expense tags over generic alternatives).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,EmployeeServiceShareBasedCompensationNonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the ground truth tag mapping. The model correctly recognized that 13.3 and 0.8 are intrinsic values of options exercised (so the OptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue tag is appropriate) and that 83.6 is total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense (the NonvestedAwardsTotalCompensationCostNotYetRecognized tag is appropriate). The only discrepancy is the third item (71,000). The sentence reads: \\\"Included in the RSU grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, are approximately 71,000 RSUs...\\\" That phrasing explicitly ties the number to RSU grants during the nine-month period (a flow: grants in period). The model instead mapped that number to a nonvested outstanding count (NonvestedNumber), which refers to the stock of nonvested awards outstanding at a point in time, not grants during a period. The ground truth uses the GrantsInPeriod tag for equity instruments other than options, which exactly matches the temporal phrasing \\\"for the nine months ended ...\\\" plus the noun \\\"grants.\\\"\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mislabeled the 71,000 RSUs as ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsNonvestedNumber instead of the correct ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model conflated two related but distinct concepts: (a) grants made during a reporting period (a flow, typically signaled by phrases like \\\"grants for the [period]\\\", \\\"granted during the period\\\", \\\"in the [period]\\\") and (b) the number of nonvested awards outstanding (a stock, signaled by words like \\\"nonvested\\\", \\\"outstanding\\\", \\\"at period end\\\"). It relied on a general 'share-based' heuristic rather than attending to the syntactic cue \\\"grants for the nine months ended...\\\" that indicates \\\"GrantsInPeriod.\\\"\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Parse the local syntactic and temporal cues before choosing a tag. Specifically: (1) when the sentence contains the noun \\\"grants\\\" or a verb like \\\"granted\\\" combined with a period indicator (\\\"for the nine months ended\\\"), map to the GrantsInPeriod tag; (2) when the sentence uses \\\"nonvested\\\", \\\"outstanding\\\", or references a balance at a point in time (\\\"at September 30\\\"), map to NonvestedNumber; (3) treat \\\"exercised\\\" and \\\"intrinsic value\\\" as OptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue. For the 71,000 example, the model should have detected the phrase \\\"RSU grants for the nine months ended...\\\" and selected ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Distinguish flows (\\\"grants in period\\\", \\\"awarded during\\\") from stocks (\\\"outstanding\\\", \\\"nonvested\\\", \\\"at period end\\\") using explicit temporal phrases. Use the noun/verb near the numeric entity (grants/granted vs nonvested/outstanding vs exercised) as the primary signal for choosing between GrantsInPeriod, NonvestedNumber, and OptionsExercisesInPeriod tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
