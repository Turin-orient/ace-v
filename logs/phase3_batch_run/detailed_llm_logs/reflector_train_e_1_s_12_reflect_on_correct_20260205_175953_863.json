Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of research and development tax credits , offset by additional income tax expense due to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the lowering of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % under H . R . 1 , informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which was enacted into law on December 22 , 2017 ( the Tax Reform ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"21\" in sentence: \"The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of research and development tax credits , offset by additional income tax expense due to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the lowering of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % under H . R . 1 , informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which was enacted into law on December 22 , 2017 ( the Tax Reform ) .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"Among other matters , the Tax Reform lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1 , 2018 , and transitioned U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"21\" in sentence: \"Among other matters , the Tax Reform lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1 , 2018 , and transitioned U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Identify the numeric tokens (35% and 21%) and their lexical anchors. In both sentences the percentages are explicitly described as the \\\"corporate federal income tax rate\\\" and as the \\\"U.S. statutory rate\\\" (or the rate being lowered to a new statutory rate). Step 2: Select the most specific US GAAP tag that captures a federal statutory tax-rate used in effective tax-rate reconciliation. From the provided taxonomy, EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate is the exact tag representing the federal statutory rate used in reconciliation. Step 3: Reject alternatives: EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations refers to the entity's effective tax rate, not the statutory rate; other percentage/interest tags (DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage, DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1, ConcentrationRiskPercentage1) are unrelated to tax-rate context. Conclusion: each numeric entity (35% and 21%) in both sentences maps to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate because the text explicitly labels them as the federal statutory income tax rate (before and after Tax Reform).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00013\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate,EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly identified the numeric tokens (35% and 21%) as references to the corporate federal income tax rate in both sentences. The textual cues \\\"corporate federal income tax rate\\\" and the context of an effective tax-rate reconciliation point directly to the GAAP concept of the federal statutory tax rate used in tax-rate reconciliations. From the provided tag list, EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate is the specific and unambiguous match for that concept. The model rejected unrelated percentage tags (e.g., interest‑rate or concentration‑risk tags) correctly because those do not align with tax-rate reconciliation context. Therefore mapping each numeric entity to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate is correct for all four items.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the predicted tags match the ground truth exactly. The reasoning, tag selection, and grounding in lexical anchors were appropriate.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable here because there was no incorrect reasoning or misapplication of concepts. The model understood both the domain concept (federal statutory tax rate) and the tag taxonomy correctly.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using the approach applied: (1) locate the numeric token and its lexical anchor in the sentence, (2) determine the precise accounting concept referenced (here, federal statutory income tax rate used in reconciliations), and (3) select the tag that exactly names that concept from the tag list. If multiple similar tags exist, prefer the one whose label most precisely matches the textual description.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a percentage is explicitly described as a \\\"federal statutory income tax rate\\\" (or as the U.S. statutory rate in an effective tax-rate reconciliation), the correct tag from a GAAP taxonomy is EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate. Anchor on the lexical phrase that names the accounting concept and map to the tag whose name most closely matches that phrase.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
