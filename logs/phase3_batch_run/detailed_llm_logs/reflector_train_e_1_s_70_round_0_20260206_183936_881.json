Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"70,000\" in sentence: \"Entitlement Transfer Agreement In December 2016 , the San Francisco Venture entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Lennar and Castlelake pursuant to which an affiliate of Lennar and Castlelake agreed to transfer to the San Francisco Venture entitlements for the right to construct ( 1 ) at least 172 homesites ( or , if greater , the number of entitled homesites that are not developed or to be developed by or on behalf of the San Francisco Agency or by residential developers on the land transferred to CPHP ) and ( 2 ) at least 70,000 square feet of retail space ( or , if greater , the amount of entitled retail space that is not developed or to be developed by or on behalf of the San Francisco Agency or by commercial developers on the land transferred to CPHP ) for use in the development of other portions of The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point . Builder Fees In the normal course of business , the Company enters into purchase and sale agreements with related parties .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"1.7\" in sentence: \"For the nine months ended September 30 , 2016 , development management fees were $ 1.7 million .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"65.1\" in sentence: \"NOTES PAYABLE At September 30 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 , notes payable consisted of the following ( in thousands ) : On November 13 , 2014 , in connection with entering into the Mall Venture and Mall DAA , a wholly - owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Venture issued a promissory note ( the \" Macerich Note \" ) to an affiliate of the Macerich Member in the amount of $ 65.1 million , bearing interest at 360 - day LIBOR plus 2.0 % ( 3.78 % at September 30 , 2017 ) .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.0\" in sentence: \"NOTES PAYABLE At September 30 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 , notes payable consisted of the following ( in thousands ) : On November 13 , 2014 , in connection with entering into the Mall Venture and Mall DAA , a wholly - owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Venture issued a promissory note ( the \" Macerich Note \" ) to an affiliate of the Macerich Member in the amount of $ 65.1 million , bearing interest at 360 - day LIBOR plus 2.0 % ( 3.78 % at September 30 , 2017 ) .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: The phrase '70,000 square feet of retail space' is an area measure (square feet) describing real estate; the most specific tag in the list for an area of property is AreaOfRealEstateProperty. (Use area-of-property lexical mapping.)\\n\\nQ2: 'development management fees were $1.7 million' is an expense line. The excerpt context mentions related-party arrangements just prior, implying these fees are likely related-party expenses disclosed in the same note. The best matching tag for an expense arising from related‑party transactions in the provided taxonomy is RelatedPartyTransactionExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty.\\n\\nQ3: 'issued a promissory note ... in the amount of $65.1 million' — this is the stated principal/face amount of a debt instrument (promissory note). The appropriate tag is DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (face/aggregate principal amount of the note).\\n\\nQ4: 'bearing interest at 360-day LIBOR plus 2.0%' — the 'plus 2.0%' is a margin/spread over LIBOR. Per the 'LIBOR plus X%' rule, this should be mapped to DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1.\\n\\nI applied the playbook heuristics: identify unit/context (area vs currency vs percent), detect related-party cue near the fee, map debt principal to face amount (instrument-anchor + principal phrase), and map 'LIBOR plus X%' to basis spread. Double-checked token-level semantics to avoid mapping the spread to a stated-rate tag or the 65.1 to a generic borrowing-capacity tag.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00009\",\"ctx-00003\",\"ph-00006\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"AreaOfRealEstateProperty,RelatedPartyTransactionExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nAreaOfRealEstateProperty,RelatedPartyTransactionExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nAreaOfRealEstateProperty,RelatedPartyTransactionExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty,LongTermDebt,DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's trace to the ground truth and the source text. For Q3 the model labeled the $65.1 million amount as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount because it matched the literal phrase 'in the amount of $65.1 million' and that tag can describe a debt instrument's principal. However the sentence sits inside a 'NOTES PAYABLE' disclosure: 'At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, notes payable consisted of the following (in thousands): On November 13, 2014 ... issued a promissory note ... in the amount of $65.1 million ...' The disclosure is enumerating the carrying/balance classification of debt on the balance sheet (notes payable / long-term debt), so the taxonomy label expected by the ground truth is the balance-sheet line item LongTermDebt. The model correctly handled Q1 (AreaOfRealEstateProperty) and Q2 (RelatedPartyTransactionExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty) and Q4 (DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1). The only mismatch is Q3, where the model applied an issuance/principal tagging heuristic instead of a balance-sheet classification heuristic.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the $65.1 million note as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount rather than LongTermDebt. It focused on the phrase 'in the amount of $65.1 million' (interpreting it as the instrument's face/principal) without taking into account the disclosure context ('NOTES PAYABLE' section enumerating notes payable balances) that signals a balance-sheet category (LongTermDebt).\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a misapplied mapping heuristic: treating any explicit monetary amount tied to a debt instrument as a DebtInstrumentFaceAmount, rather than first checking the document/disclosure context (note header, 'notes payable', 'consisted of the following', period-end dates) which indicates whether the amount represents a balance-sheet liability classification. The model therefore confused instrument-level attributes with statement-line balances.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Before mapping a monetary debt amount to a tag, determine whether the sentence is listing balance-sheet classifications or describing issuance terms. Use headings and context cues: 'NOTES PAYABLE', 'At [date]', and 'consisted of the following' indicate a balance-sheet note — prefer LongTermDebt (or ShortTermDebt if maturity/current classification indicates) over DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. Reserve DebtInstrumentFaceAmount for contexts that describe an instrument's stated principal at issuance when the discussion is about the instrument itself rather than a balance-sheet line item. Concretely: 1) detect section header / disclosure scope; 2) if under notes payable or long-term liabilities, map to LongTermDebt; 3) if the phrase appears in an issuance narrative outside a balance-sheet listing, consider DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Context beats lexical cues: monetary amounts for debt must be interpreted with the disclosure context (notes payable/statement date/listing vs instrument issuance narrative). When an amount appears inside a balance-sheet disclosure or 'notes payable' listing, prefer LongTermDebt (or current portion) rather than DebtInstrumentFaceAmount.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
