Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"ten\" in sentence: \"Intangible assets consist of legal fees incurred for patents and are recorded at cost and amortized over the useful lives of the assets of ten years , using the straight - line method .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"Intangible assets consist of legal fees incurred for patents and are recorded at cost and amortized over the useful lives of the assets of ten years , using the straight - line method .?\"\n3.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each of the four predicted tag mappings against the ground truth and the source sentences. For Q1–Q2 the model correctly mapped the phrase describing a finite useful life to FiniteLivedIntangibleAssetUsefulLife. For Q3 the sentence reads: \\\"At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our debt obligations approximated the carrying amount of $73,000.\\\" The model tagged $73,000 as DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount (i.e., carrying amount). The ground truth, however, expects LongTermDebtFairValue — the disclosure is part of a fair-value discussion, and the numeric statement is presented in the context of fair-value measurement of debt. For Q4 the sentence states rent expense of $3.9 million. The model chose OperatingLeaseExpense; the ground truth expects the broader LeaseAndRentalExpense tag. In summary: the model correctly handled useful-life mapping but mis-mapped the debt number (confused carrying amount vs the fact being reported for fair value) and chose a narrower lease expense tag instead of the taxonomy's preferred LeaseAndRentalExpense.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Two specific errors: (1) For the $73,000 item the model picked DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount but ground truth expects LongTermDebtFairValue — the model treated the number as the carrying amount instead of mapping it to the fair-value disclosure context. (2) For the $3.9 million rent item the model chose OperatingLeaseExpense instead of the taxonomy tag LeaseAndRentalExpense used in the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model failed for Q3 because it focused on the literal grammatical attachment (\\\"carrying amount of $73,000\\\") and selected a carrying-amount tag, rather than recognizing the primary disclosure topic: fair-value measurement of debt. It did not prioritize the semantic emphasis (the sentence introduces fair-value measurement) over a surface syntactic reading. For Q4 the error arose from conflating similarly named tags: \\\"OperatingLeaseExpense\\\" vs a taxonomy's canonical \\\"LeaseAndRentalExpense.\\\" The model defaulted to an 'operating-lease' label because it saw 'rent' and 'years' in the surrounding sentences, rather than choosing the taxonomy tag that matches how rent expense is reported in this taxonomy.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Q3: When a sentence explicitly discusses fair value (\\\"the fair value of our debt obligations ...\\\"), map the numeric amount to the fair-value tag even if the number is compared to carrying amount. Determine which financial metric the sentence is primarily about — here it's fair value of long-term debt — and use LongTermDebtFairValue. Q4: Use the canonical taxonomy expense tag for rent disclosures. If the sentence states \\\"rent expense\\\" or a rental cost, prefer LeaseAndRentalExpense (or the taxonomy's designated rent/lease expense element) rather than a narrower OperatingLeaseExpense unless the sentence specifically labels the amount as an operating-lease accounting element distinct in the taxonomy. In general: (a) identify the disclosure concept (fair value vs carrying amount, or rent vs operating-lease-specific metric), (b) choose the taxonomy element that matches that concept (not merely a similarly named element), and (c) when in doubt, prefer the taxonomy element that matches the explicit disclosure verb (e.g., \\\"fair value\\\" → fair value tag; \\\"rent expense\\\" → lease and rental expense tag).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map facts to the concept the sentence emphasizes, not just the closest noun phrase. If a sentence explicitly discusses fair-value measurement, tag the numeric as a fair-value element even when a carrying amount is referenced. For expense disclosures, prefer the taxonomy's canonical expense tag (LeaseAndRentalExpense for rent) rather than an intuitively similar but narrower element. When two plausible tags exist, use the explicit measurement label (\\\"fair value\\\", \\\"carrying amount\\\", \\\"expense\\\", etc.) as the deciding factor.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
