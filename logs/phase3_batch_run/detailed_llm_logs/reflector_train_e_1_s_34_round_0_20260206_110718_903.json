Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"312\" in sentence: \"As of December 31 , 2017 , there were outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $ 312 which are scheduled to expire in 2018 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"10,000\" in sentence: \"Under the 2014 Plan , non - employee directors may continue to receive an annual option grant for no more than 10,000 shares .?\"\n3.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each question, the model's chosen tag, and the ground truth. Q1: The model mapped \\\"$312 outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees\\\" to LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount. That matches the ground truth, so this was correct. Q2: The sentence refers to \\\"non-employee directors may continue to receive an annual option grant for no more than 10,000 shares.\\\" The model interpreted this as a plan-level maximum authorized shares (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized). The ground truth expects OptionsGrantsInPeriodGross. The correct semantic framing is that this statement sets the maximum size of an annual grant (a grant quantity), not the overall plan authorization. Q3: The sentence states \\\"options to purchase 989,081 shares ... were authorized and reserved for future grant.\\\" The model mapped this to CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance, treating it as a general equity reserves concept. The ground truth expects the number to be the share-based-compensation plan's number of shares authorized (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized). The correct interpretation privileges the plan-specific authorization tag because the subject is options under the share-based plan. Q4: The model correctly mapped the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options ($1.14) to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue, which matches the ground truth. In short, the two errors come from mis-prioritizing whether the numeric entity pertains to (a) a grant quantity in a period versus an overall authorized number, and (b) a share-based-compensation-plan-specific authorization versus a general common stock reserved-for-issuance label.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Two mislabels: (1) For '10,000' the model chose the plan authorization tag instead of a grants-in-period gross tag — it misread a per-award/per-period grant cap as an authorization. (2) For '989,081' the model chose a general equity reserved-for-future-issuance tag instead of the share-based-compensation plan's number-of-shares-authorized tag — it ignored the context that this number refers to options under the share-based plan.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Both errors stem from context-selection mistakes: the model failed to correctly determine the scope of the numeric value (is it describing a grant amount vs. plan authorization?) and to prefer plan-specific tags when the sentence explicitly references option grants/authorization. The model applied a surface cue (\\\"reserved\\\" -> CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance) without integrating the full subject ('options to purchase' and 'under the plan'), and in the other case it treated a phrase describing a grant limit as a plan-level authorization.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Apply a two-step disambiguation rule for numeric entities: (1) identify the subject and action (e.g., 'grant', 'authorized', 'reserved', 'issued', 'reserved for future grant'), and (2) map to the most specific tag that matches that subject. Concretely: if wording mentions an 'option grant' or a limit on an 'annual option grant' (per director, per period), prefer grants-in-period tags (OptionsGrantsInPeriodGross) rather than plan-authorized tags. If the sentence explicitly says 'authorized' in the context of options or share-based awards, prefer the share-based-compensation authorization tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized) rather than a generic CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance tag. Also, when 'reserved for future grant' appears alongside 'authorized' and the subject is options, that combination points to the plan-authorized shares for the share-based arrangement.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always resolve the entity's grammatical subject and action first (is it a 'grant', an 'authorization', a 'reservation'?), then choose the tag that is specific to that subject (share-based-compensation plan tags when the entity concerns options/grants). Favor 'grants-in-period' tags for per-period grant amounts/limits and 'number-of-shares-authorized' tags for plan authorization counts, even when 'reserved' language is present.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
