Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"13,693\" in sentence: \"Gains on extinguishment of debt of $ 13,693 were recorded during the six months ended June 30 , 2017 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"three\" in sentence: \"The Company is comprised of three unique operating units , or divisions , classified into reportable segments : Applied Technology , Engineered Films , and Aerostar .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"75\" in sentence: \"The Company owns a 75 % interest in an entity consolidated under the Aerostar business segment .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"280\" in sentence: \"The Company recorded a $ 280 reclassification entry for the stranded tax effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to Raven 's post - retirement plan further disclosed in the Company 's Annual Report in the Form 10-K filed March 23 , 2018 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I mapped each numeric to the most specific US GAAP element by applying the playbook heuristics. 1) \\\"$13,693\\\" occurs in the phrase 'Gains on extinguishment of debt ... were recorded' — literal lexical cue 'Gains on Extinguishment of Debt' directly maps to GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt (ctx-00001 footnote/component heuristic supports mapping footnote/explicit aggregate labels to the corresponding gains-on-extinguishment tag). 2) 'three unique operating units ... classified into reportable segments' quantifies the number of operating/reportable segments — map to NumberOfOperatingSegments per the Count-of-business-lines rule (ctx-00011). 3) 'owns a 75% interest' states the parent's ownership percentage in a consolidated entity — the appropriate tag is MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByParent (ownership percentage by the parent). 4) 'a $280 reclassification entry for the stranded tax effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ... post-retirement plan' describes an income-tax reclassification (tax effect moved out of AOCI) — this is an income-tax line item best represented as IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit (tax reclassification/benefit/expense mapping per tax-line polarity and reclassification heuristics, ctx-00003). I verified that each chosen tag exists in the provided tag list and that no stronger, more specific tag from the list better fits the exact lexical context.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\", \"ctx-00011\", \"ctx-00003\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,NumberOfOperatingSegments,MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByParent,IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nGainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,NumberOfOperatingSegments,MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByParent,IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nGainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt,NumberOfReportableSegments,MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByParent,CumulativeEffectOfNewAccountingPrincipleInPeriodOfAdoption\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared each predicted tag to the ground truth and traced the decision points in the model's mapping. Q1: the model mapped \\\"$13,693\\\" to GainsLossesOnExtinguishmentOfDebt — this matches the ground truth and is correct because the phrase explicitly names gains on extinguishment of debt. Q2: the model mapped the count \\\"three\\\" to NumberOfOperatingSegments, while the ground truth is NumberOfReportableSegments. The sentence explicitly uses the phrase \\\"classified into reportable segments,\\\" so the correct, more specific tag is NumberOfReportableSegments. The model over-generalized from the concept of operating segments to the less appropriate tag. Q3: the model chose MinorityInterestOwnershipPercentageByParent for \\\"75% interest\\\" — this matches ground truth and is correct. Q4: the model mapped the $280 reclassification for \\\"stranded tax effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\\" to IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit, but the ground truth is CumulativeEffectOfNewAccountingPrincipleInPeriodOfAdoption. The phrase describes a reclassification in AOCI connected to a post‑retirement plan and references the Annual Report filing; that context indicates a one-time adoption/cumulative-effect adjustment (e.g., reclassification recorded on adoption), not a recurring period income tax expense. The model misinterpreted \\\"reclassification\\\" and \\\"tax effects\\\" as routine tax expense instead of a cumulative effect from adoption.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Two specific errors: (1) Replacing the precise tag NumberOfReportableSegments with the more general NumberOfOperatingSegments — a specificity/lexical-match error. (2) Mapping an AOCI reclassification tied to stranded tax effects to IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit instead of CumulativeEffectOfNewAccountingPrincipleInPeriodOfAdoption — a contextual-interpretation error that ignored the adoption/cumulative-effect signal.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model favored broader or generic interpretations rather than exact lexical matches and contextual signals. For Q2 it applied a general 'count-of-segments' heuristic instead of prioritizing the explicit phrase \\\"reportable segments.\\\" For Q4 it applied a generic tax-tag heuristic whenever 'tax' appeared, failing to recognize that the combination of terms ('reclassification entry', 'stranded tax effects', 'Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income', and the filing/adoption context) points to a one-time cumulative effect on adoption rather than a routine period tax expense.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1) Prioritize exact lexical matches: if the text contains the phrase \\\"reportable segments,\\\" prefer NumberOfReportableSegments over NumberOfOperatingSegments. 2) Use contextual cue rules for reclassifications: when you see 'reclassification entry' combined with 'stranded tax effects' and 'Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income' — and especially when it's tied to an Annual Report or a specific filing/adoption reference — prefer CumulativeEffectOfNewAccountingPrincipleInPeriodOfAdoption if that tag exists. 3) Implement a tie-breaker that prefers the more specific tag present in the candidate list when both general and specific tags are plausible. 4) When uncertain, scan for nearby words indicating timing/nature (\\\"in period of adoption\\\", \\\"reclassification entry\\\", \\\"stranded\\\", \\\"cumulative\\\", \\\"adoption\\\", \\\"filed\\\"), and map to cumulative/adoption tags rather than recurring expense tags.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always prefer the most specific tag that matches the exact wording in context. For counts, match the exact noun (\\\"reportable segments\\\" vs \\\"operating segments\\\"). For tax/AOCI reclassifications, treat 'reclassification' + 'stranded tax effects' + 'AOCI' + any filing/adoption reference as a strong signal for a cumulative-effect/adoption tag rather than a routine income‑tax expense tag.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
