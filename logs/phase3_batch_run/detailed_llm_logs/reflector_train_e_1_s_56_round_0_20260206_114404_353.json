Playbook rules (borrowing base / 'amount available' mapping) map this to LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity. 2) $150.0 is described as 'aggregate principal amount of senior notes' — exact-descriptor 'principal amount' / 'notes issued' maps to DebtInstrumentFaceAmount (face/principal amount of notes). 3) $15.0 is one component of that aggregate principal amount for Series A senior notes — likewise a note face/principal amount -> DebtInstrumentFaceAmount. 4) 4.03% appears immediately adjacent to 'Senior Notes' and is a stated coupon rate; percent+instrument-anchor mapping maps this to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. I applied borrowing-base/availability rules (ctx-00005/ctx-00009), descriptor precedence for debt principal (ctx-00012), facility/instrument attachment gating (ctx-00025) and percent+instrument heuristics (ctx-00029) to select the most specific tags.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ctx-00009\",\n    \"ctx-00012\",\n    \"ctx-00025\",\n    \"ctx-00029\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nLineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentFaceAmount,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I examined the model's trace and the ground truth. The model correctly tagged the three debt-related entities: the $150.0 and $15.0 amounts as DebtInstrumentFaceAmount and the 4.03% coupon as DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. The only mismatch is the first tag: model predicted LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity while ground truth is LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity. The sentence reads: \\\"$618.0 million is available to borrow without adding additional properties to the unencumbered borrowing base of assets.\\\" The phrase \\\"available to borrow\\\" and the immediate context of the borrowing base describe the facility's capacity at that time (the current amount that can be drawn), so the taxonomy element that best matches is CurrentBorrowingCapacity. The model instead applied a rule that mapped 'available' and 'borrowing base' to a 'remaining' capacity concept. The remainder of the model's reasoning (mapping principal amounts to face amount and percentage to stated interest rate) used appropriate lexical anchors (\\\"aggregate principal amount,\\\" percent adjacent to note name) and are correct.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The specific error is selecting LineOfCreditFacilityRemainingBorrowingCapacity instead of LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity for the $618.0 amount. The model misapplied the borrowing-base / availability rule and equated the phrase \\\"available to borrow\\\" with a 'remaining' capacity concept rather than the taxonomy element that denotes the facility's current borrowing capacity.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a semantic mapping mistake: confusing two similar taxonomy concepts (\\\"remaining\\\" vs \\\"current\\\" borrowing capacity). The model relied on a heuristic that treated the token 'available' as implying 'remaining' capacity under a committed facility, instead of checking the taxonomy definitions and the precise anchor phrasing 'available to borrow' which usually maps to the facility's current borrowing capacity at the reporting date. This stems from an overly coarse rule that doesn't distinguish the subtle difference between 'remaining' (could imply leftover after commitments or a residual concept) and 'current' (the explicit capacity available at the reporting date).\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Instead of using the broad 'available -> remaining' heuristic, the model should: 1) consult the taxonomy gloss/definition for candidates when close synonyms exist (CurrentBorrowingCapacity vs RemainingBorrowingCapacity), 2) prioritize exact phrase anchors: phrases like 'is available to borrow' or 'is available under the facility' should map to CurrentBorrowingCapacity, 3) reserve 'RemainingBorrowingCapacity' for contexts that explicitly discuss unused capacity after drawings or specify 'remaining under committed facility after borrowings' or similar wording. Applying this approach would yield LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity for $618.0.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When two taxonomy terms are semantically similar, rely on (a) the precise lexical anchor in the sentence (e.g., 'is available to borrow' -> current capacity) and (b) taxonomy definitions rather than a single-token heuristic. Prefer 'current' when the text states an amount 'is available' at the reporting time; use 'remaining' only when the text explicitly frames the amount as a leftover after others draws or commitments.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00005\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00012\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00025\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00029\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\n  ]\n}",
