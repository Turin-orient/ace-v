Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"7.625\" in sentence: \"AK Steel has outstanding 7.625 % Senior Notes due October 2021 ( the “ 2021 Notes ” ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"7.625\" in sentence: \"The 2021 Notes were issued under a supplemental indenture , which includes covenants and restrictions substantially similar to the existing indentures governing the 7.625 % Senior Notes due 2020 and the 8.375 % Senior Notes due 2022 and are equal in right of payment to those notes .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"8.375\" in sentence: \"The 2021 Notes were issued under a supplemental indenture , which includes covenants and restrictions substantially similar to the existing indentures governing the 7.625 % Senior Notes due 2020 and the 8.375 % Senior Notes due 2022 and are equal in right of payment to those notes .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"103.813\" in sentence: \"Before October 1 , 2017 , we may redeem the 2021 Notes at a price equal to par plus a make whole premium and all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption After that date , they are redeemable at 103.813 % until October 1 , 2018 , 101.906 % thereafter until October 1 , 2019 , and 100.0 % thereafter , together with all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1–3) Each percentage (7.625% and 8.375%) directly modifies a named debt instrument ('Senior Notes'), so per the percent-as-instrument-coupon and per‑instrument interest-rate heuristics these are stated interest rates on the debt. Therefore map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. 4) The 103.813% figure is the contractual redemption price (a price expressed as a percentage of par for early redemption), so map to DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage.

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed the model's trace and the four entities in context. For items 1–3 the percentages (7.625% and 8.375%) directly qualify named debt instruments ('Senior Notes due ...') and are presented as coupon/interest rates for those notes. The correct mapping is DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. For item 4 the phrase 'they are redeemable at 103.813% until ...' clearly indicates a contractual redemption price expressed as a percentage of par, so DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage is the correct mapping. The model applied a simple, correct heuristic: percent values that describe the stated interest rate on a debt instrument map to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage; percent values that describe a redemption price map to DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage. The predicted tags exactly match the ground truth.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and final answers are correct and match the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable in this case because the mapping and heuristics were applied correctly. However, potential conceptual confusions that could lead to errors (but did not here) include misinterpreting a percent as a rate versus a price or confusing an interest-rate percentage with a covenant threshold or fee percentage.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue to (1) locate the noun that the percentage modifies (e.g., 'Senior Notes', 'redeemable'), (2) read surrounding verbs/phrases for semantic clues ('due', 'issued', 'interest', 'redeemable at', 'price equal to par'), and (3) map 'interest rate' contexts to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage and 'redeemable at X%' or 'redeemal price' contexts to DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage. When in doubt, prefer interpreting the percent as a coupon only if it directly modifies a debt instrument with an explicit rate expression (e.g., '7.625% Senior Notes').\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Heuristic: if a percentage directly modifies a debt instrument name or is described with language like '7.625% Senior Notes' it's a stated interest rate (DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage). If the percentage appears with redemption language ('redeemable at X%', 'at a price equal to X% of par') it's a redemption-price percentage (DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
