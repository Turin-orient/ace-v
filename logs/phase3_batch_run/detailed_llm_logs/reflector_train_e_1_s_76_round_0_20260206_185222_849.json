Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"13,228\" in sentence: \"On July 9 , 2018 , the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company granted each of the four non - employee directors 13,228 RSUs in accordance with a RSU Grant Agreement pursuant to the Company 's 2009 LTIP , as amended .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"three\" in sentence: \"The RSUs will be subject to three year cliff vesting , with the entire award vesting 36 months from the grant date .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"year\" in sentence: \"The RSUs will be subject to three year cliff vesting , with the entire award vesting 36 months from the grant date .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"36\" in sentence: \"The RSUs will be subject to three year cliff vesting , with the entire award vesting 36 months from the grant date .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) '13,228 RSUs' — the sentence uses the verb 'granted' and refers to RSU grants under the Company's LTIP (plan anchor). Per grant-mapping rules, share counts tied to 'granted' map to the grants-in-period share-based-compensation tag. 2) 'three' (as in 'three year cliff vesting') — this quantifies the award vesting period; map to the award-vesting-period tag. 3) 'year' — the time unit of the vesting period; it belongs to the same vesting-period concept and maps to the award-vesting-period tag. 4) '36' (months) — the alternative period expression (36 months) likewise maps to the award-vesting-period tag. (Applied rules: 'granted'→grants-in-period; plan-anchor reinforces share‑based mapping; numeric + period/unit → award vesting period tag.)\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00010\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"err-00013\",\n    \"err-00022\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly identified that '13,228 RSUs' are a grants-in-period share-based compensation amount and that the phrases 'three' and 'year' express the vesting period. The error occurs only on the fourth item: the model tagged '36' (months) as an AwardVestingPeriod when the ground truth expects an ExpirationPeriod tag. The model applied a blanket rule \\\"numeric + period/unit -> award vesting period\\\" without checking the finer contextual semantics. In the sentence the phrase is: \\\"with the entire award vesting 36 months from the grant date.\\\" Linguistically, that expresses a time-to-vesting measured from the grant date (a term/expiration-like expression) rather than a generic vesting-period label already captured by \\\"three year cliff vesting.\\\" The taxonomy separates the vesting period concept (AwardVestingPeriod1) from an award expiration/term concept (ExpirationPeriod). The model failed to detect that the explicit \\\"36 months from the grant date\\\" construction corresponds to the award's expiration/term measurement and should be mapped to SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mis-tagged the token '36' by mapping it to AwardVestingPeriod1 instead of SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. It overgeneralized the rule for period expressions and did not inspect the clause-level semantics 'vesting 36 months from the grant date.'\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause is a conceptual confusion between two related but distinct taxonomy concepts: vesting period vs award expiration/term. The model treated all numeric time expressions tied to share awards as vesting-period values. It also failed to apply clause-level cues (\\\"from the grant date\\\") that indicate a time-to-expiration/term measurement rather than the generic vesting-period label already provided by \\\"three year cliff vesting.\\\" In short, a coarse mapping rule was used instead of a context-sensitive semantic mapping.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Differentiate the two concepts when mapping: (1) Use ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1 for phrases that state the vesting schedule length (e.g., \\\"three year cliff vesting,\\\" \\\"three years\\\"), and (2) use SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod when the sentence gives an explicit time-to-event anchored to a date (phrases like \\\"vesting 36 months from the grant date,\\\" \\\"expires X months from grant\\\"). Concretely, the model should have tagged: - '13,228' -> GrantsInPeriod tag (as it did), - 'three' and 'year' -> AwardVestingPeriod1 (as it did), and - '36' -> SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod because the construction \\\"36 months from the grant date\\\" denotes an expiration/term anchor.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Do not treat all numeric time/unit phrases the same. Use syntactic/semantic anchors (verbs like 'vest' vs 'expire', prepositional phrases like 'from the grant date', and whether a separate vesting phrase already appears) to choose between vesting-period and expiration/term tags.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
