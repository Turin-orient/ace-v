Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"21.0\" in sentence: \"Total associated exit and disposal costs are expected to be between $ 17.5 million to $ 21.0 million , including : • Non - cash accelerated depreciation of long - lived assets at the Oklahoma facility , which is primarily property , plant and equipment that will not be transferred to Ohio ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.5 million expected to be recognized ratably through the first quarter of 2019 ) , • Costs to relocate and install equipment ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.0 million , expected to be incurred primarily in the second half of 2018 ) , • Employee retention and termination benefits ( approximately $ 2.5 million , expected to be incurred ratably through the second half of 2018 ) , • Other associated costs related to the closure of the facility and internal administration of the project ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.0 million , expected to be incurred primarily in the second half of 2018 ) .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"5.0\" in sentence: \"Total associated exit and disposal costs are expected to be between $ 17.5 million to $ 21.0 million , including : • Non - cash accelerated depreciation of long - lived assets at the Oklahoma facility , which is primarily property , plant and equipment that will not be transferred to Ohio ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.5 million expected to be recognized ratably through the first quarter of 2019 ) , • Costs to relocate and install equipment ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.0 million , expected to be incurred primarily in the second half of 2018 ) , • Employee retention and termination benefits ( approximately $ 2.5 million , expected to be incurred ratably through the second half of 2018 ) , • Other associated costs related to the closure of the facility and internal administration of the project ( between $ 5.0 million to $ 6.0 million , expected to be incurred primarily in the second half of 2018 ) .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"5.1\" in sentence: \"64 Table of Contents During 2017 , exit and disposal expense totaled $ 5.1 million , primarily related to employee termination benefits and accelerated depreciation .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"4.2\" in sentence: \"The Program allows for up to 4.2 million awards to eligible employees of stock options , restricted stock , stock appreciation rights , performance shares and units or other awards based on Company common stock .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q1: The phrase \\\"Total associated exit and disposal costs are expected to be between $17.5 million to $21.0 million\\\" is an estimate of expected restructuring/exit costs (future expected cost range). The most specific tag for an expected restructuring cost is RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1 rather than a generic expense line. Q2: The $5.0 million amount appears in the parenthetical describing \\\"Non-cash accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ... (between $5.0 million to $6.5 million expected to be recognized ...)\\\" — this is depreciation of PP&E (accelerated depreciation), so map to Depreciation. Q3: \\\"During 2017, exit and disposal expense totaled $5.1 million\\\" denotes recognized exit/disposal expense for the period (a recorded restructuring/exit expense). The correct tag is RestructuringCharges. Q4: \\\"The Program allows for up to 4.2 million awards ...\\\" is a plan-authorized maximum number of awards — a plan-authorized share count. Per plan mapping heuristics, map to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized. I applied plan/authorization rules and unit-disambiguation (share-count vs monetary) to ensure the 4.2 million is a share-authorized count and used specificity-first mapping for restructuring/expected vs recognized expense.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00008\",\n    \"ctx-00004\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1,Depreciation,RestructuringCharges,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nRestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1,Depreciation,RestructuringCharges,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nRestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1,RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1,RestructuringCharges,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's tag choices to the ground truth and traced the decision points for each question. Q1: The model chose RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1 for the $21.0M upper-bound of the stated expected exit and disposal cost range — that matches ground truth. Q2: The model mapped the $5.0M component (non‑cash accelerated depreciation) to Depreciation because it focused on the word \\\"depreciation\\\" and treated it as a generic PP&E depreciation amount. However, in the sentence the $5.0–$6.5M figure is explicitly a component of the expected exit and disposal costs; the ground truth maps such components to the restructuring expected cost tag (RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1). Q3: The model picked RestructuringCharges for the recognized $5.1M exit/disposal expense — that matches ground truth (recognized expense tag). Q4: The model chose ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized for \\\"up to 4.2 million awards.\\\" The ground truth uses ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. The difference is a nuance: \\\"allows for up to 4.2 million awards\\\" describes the program pool currently available for grant (or maximum awards allowed to be granted), not the scheme's total authorized shares. In sum, the two incorrect mappings stem from misreading contextual scope (component vs standalone) and misinterpreting wording nuance (authorized vs available for grant).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Two specific mistakes: (1) The model mapped the $5.0M depreciation component to the generic Depreciation tag instead of using the restructuring expected-cost component tag. (2) The model mapped the 4.2M awards to the 'authorized' shares tag rather than 'available for grant.'\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Both errors are context/semantics problems rather than numerical mistakes. For Q2, the model applied a surface-level keyword heuristic ('depreciation' -> Depreciation) and failed to consider that the amount is a line-item within an expected restructuring cost disclosure — the taxonomy provides a more specific tag representing components of expected exit/disposal costs. For Q4, the model conflated similar plan-related tags because it did not correctly parse the modal phrase 'allows for up to' that signals the number refers to awards available to be granted (pool) rather than total authorized shares.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When a monetary amount appears as a component of a higher-level restructuring or exit/disposal estimate, prefer the restructuring expected-cost tag (RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1) over a generic accounting line (Depreciation). Concretely: map the $5.0–$6.5M accelerated depreciation line to RestructuringAndRelatedCostExpectedCost1 because it is described as part of the exit/disposal cost estimate. For share plans, parse modal and quantifier language: phrases like 'allows for up to X awards' or 'available for grant' indicate the current available pool — use ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant. Only use the 'Authorized' tag when the text explicitly says 'authorized' or 'shares authorized.'\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Do not rely solely on local keywords. Always interpret numeric entities in their broader sentence context: (a) if an amount is listed as a component of an overall restructuring/exit cost estimate, map to the restructuring expected-cost component tag; (b) for share counts, distinguish 'authorized', 'reserved', 'available for grant', and 'issued' by the exact modal verbs and nouns in the sentence ('allows for', 'authorized', 'reserved', 'available').\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
