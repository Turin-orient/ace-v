Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"487\" in sentence: \"The fair value of our Senior Notes due 2026 ( as defined below ) was $ 487 million as of December 31 , 2016 .

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each question and mapped the numeric entity to the most specific US GAAP debt-related tag given the textual context. Q1 & Q2: The sentences explicitly state \\\"the fair value of our Senior Notes ... was $487 million\\\" and \\\"was $397 million\\\". The measurement term is \\\"fair value\\\" and the anchor is the senior notes (long-term debt), so the correct tag is LongTermDebtFairValue. Q3: \\\"3.550% Senior Notes\\\" is reporting the stated coupon/interest rate of the debt instrument — this corresponds to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Q4: \\\"$600 million aggregate principal amount\\\" is the face/aggregate principal amount of the debt issuance, so DebtInstrumentFaceAmount is the correct tag.
