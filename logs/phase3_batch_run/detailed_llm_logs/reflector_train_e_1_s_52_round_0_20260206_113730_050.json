Impairment and other lease charges for the three and nine months ended October 2 , 2016 consist of impairment charges of $ 18.5 million related to sixteen Company - owned Pollo Tropical restaurants that were subsequently closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and second quarter of 2017 and one Company - owned Taco Cabana restaurant that was subsequently closed in the third quarter of 2017 .?\"\n2.

The Company determined the fair value of restaurant equipment , for those restaurants reviewed for impairment , based on current economic conditions , the Company ’ s history of using these assets in the operation of its business and the Company 's expectation of how a market participant would value the assets .?\"\n3.

This is a lease-related expense line (not an asset or capitalization). Per lease heuristics (map lease-charge phrases to lease expense tags; use operating-lease expense when sentence describes \\\"lease charges\\\"), the appropriate operating-lease expense element is OperatingLeaseExpense.\\n\\n2) $0.1 million — Context: \\\"other lease charges of $0.1 million related to previously closed ... restaurants.\\\" Same lexical cue \\\"other lease charges\\\" and clearly an expense (charges related to leases). Use the same mapping as (1): OperatingLeaseExpense.\\n\\n3) 182,522 — Context: \\\"the Company granted certain employees 182,522 ... non-vested restricted shares ... under the ... Plan.\\\" Playbook: instrument-class-first (non-option equity instruments) and grants-in-period mapping when GRANT cues are present. This is a grant event (granted non-vested restricted shares) -> map to the equity-instruments-other-than-options grants-in-period element: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\\n\\n4) 50,087 — Same sentence as (3), the second quantity is the other grants-in-period amount for the prior period; apply same GRANT-in-period mapping as (3): ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod.\\n\\nI used these playbook bullets: lease/lease-charge mapping heuristics and share-based-compensation instrument/grant rules to select the most specific tags (prefer instrument-specific grants-in-period tag for non-option restricted shares rather than generic nonvested/outstanding tag).\\n\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00005\",\n    \"ctx-00011\",\n    \"ctx-00008\",\n    \"ctx-SBC-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00007\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"OperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nOperatingLeaseExpense,OperatingLeaseExpense,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nRestructuringCharges,RestructuringCharges,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardEquityInstrumentsOtherThanOptionsGrantsInPeriod\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's mapping decisions to the ground truth and the sentence context. The model mapped both $1.3M and $0.1M to OperatingLeaseExpense because it keyed on the word \\\"lease\\\" and applied a lexical rule mapping \\\"lease charges\\\" to lease expense. For the two share-based-compensation numbers (182,522 and 50,087) the model mapped both correctly to the grants-in-period tag because the phrase \\\"granted ... non-vested restricted shares\\\" directly signals a grant event of non-option equity instruments.\\n\\nExamining the sentences: both lease-charge amounts appear in the context of restaurant closures and charges related to closed restaurants (\\\"related to previously closed Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants\\\"; \\\"related to sixteen Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants that were subsequently closed...\\\"). Those are exit/closure costs and are presented together with impairment charges tied to closures. In financial reporting, charges stemming from store closures/exit activities are classified as restructuring (exit) charges rather than ordinary operating lease expense. The ground truth uses RestructuringCharges for those items, which aligns with that interpretation.\\n\\nThus the model's correct behavior on the share-based compensation items came from properly recognizing a grant event; its incorrect behavior on the lease-charge items was from over-reliance on a surface lexical rule (\\\"lease\\\" -> OperatingLeaseExpense) and failure to incorporate the event context (closures/exit activities) and the grouping/labeling cue (\\\"Impairment and other lease charges\\\" as a combined charge related to closures).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model misclassified the two \\\"other lease charges\\\" amounts as OperatingLeaseExpense. It ignored contextual cues that these charges arise from restaurant closures/exit activities and are presented alongside impairment charges related to closures, so they should be classified as RestructuringCharges.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The core mistake was a narrow lexical mapping: the model used the token \\\"lease\\\" as the dominant signal and applied a generic lease-expense tag without checking the economic event. It did not apply an event-based rule that charges tied to store closures/exit activities or described as part of impairment/closure-related charges are typically restructuring (exit) charges. In short, it prioritized word-level matching over sentence- and paragraph-level semantics.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model should have: (1) inspected the surrounding context for event signals—words like \\\"closed\\\", \\\"subsequently closed\\\", \\\"previously closed\\\", \\\"exit\\\", or \\\"restructuring\\\"—that indicate closure-related or exit costs; (2) recognized that when impairment and lease-related charges are grouped and tied to closures they are part of restructuring/exit activity; (3) prefer the RestructuringCharges tag for charges arising from closures/exit activities rather than automatically mapping any \\\"lease charge\\\" phrase to OperatingLeaseExpense; (4) still apply the lexical grant-rule for the share-based-compensation lines (which the model did correctly).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Do not rely solely on single-word lexical matches. Always combine lexical cues with event/contextual cues: if charges are linked to closures/exit activities (\\\"closed\\\", \\\"subsequently closed\\\", \\\"previously closed\\\"), treat them as restructuring/exit charges. Use hierarchical tagging: event-driven tags (RestructuringCharges) override generic expense tags (OperatingLeaseExpense) when context indicates an exit/closure event.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00005\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00011\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00008\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-SBC-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00007\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}",
