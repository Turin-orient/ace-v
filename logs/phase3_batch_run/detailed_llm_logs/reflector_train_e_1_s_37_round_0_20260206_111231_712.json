Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"years\" in sentence: \"The risk free interest rate is based on yields on U.S. Treasury STRIPS ( Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities ) with a maturity similar to the estimated expected term of the options The fair value of our stock options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted - average assumptions : Stock Options The following table summarizes the option activity under the Plans for the three months ended March 31 , 2017 : Options to purchase Class A common stock generally vest over a three - or four - year period and are generally granted for a term of ten years .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"1.0\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 1.0 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"0.6\" in sentence: \"The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 1.0 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"5.78\" in sentence: \"The weighted - average grant - date fair value of options granted during the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 5.78 and $ 6.75 , respectively .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each sentence and applied the playbook heuristics for share-based compensation and equity/plan lexical mappings. Step 1 (years — vesting/term): The sentence explicitly describes vesting periods and term for option awards: \\\"vest over a three- or four-year period\\\" and \\\"term of ten years.\\\" Per ctx-00001 (plan/equity lexical rules) and ctx-00007 (share-based two-step disambiguation) we detect a plan/option anchor and a vesting-period expression. The most specific tag for an award vesting period is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1. Step 2 (1.0 million intrinsic value): The phrase \\\"total intrinsic value of options exercised ... was $1.0 million\\\" ties a currency amount to option exercises. Instrument-class-first (ctx-00008) confirms instrument is options; ctx-00007 and ctx-00001 guide mapping exercise intrinsic values to the options-exercises intrinsic-value taxonomy element. The best-match tag is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue. Step 3 (0.6 million intrinsic value): Same reasoning and mapping as step 2 — the $0.6 million is the intrinsic value for the other period and maps to the same tag ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue. Step 4 (5.78 weighted-average grant-date fair value): The sentence gives a weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted. With an options instrument-anchor and a grant-date fair value phrase, the precise tag is ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue (per ctx-00008 and ctx-00007 guidance to prefer instrument-specific grants/weighted-average fair-value tags). I validated each chosen tag is present in the provided US GAAP tag list and is the most specific match given the context (vest/term, intrinsic value of exercised options, and grant-date weighted-average fair value).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00001\", \"ctx-00007\", \"ctx-00008\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nSharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodTotalIntrinsicValue,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodWeightedAverageGrantDateFairValue\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read the sentence and noted two different \\\"years\\\" expressions: \\\"vest over a three- or four-year period\\\" (vesting period) and \\\"are generally granted for a term of ten years\\\" (term/expiration). The model selected the vesting-period tag (ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1), but the ground truth expected the expiration tag (SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod). The model therefore anchored the generic token \\\"years\\\" to the nearby \\\"vest over ... period\\\" phrase instead of to the explicit \\\"term of ten years\\\" phrase, despite both appearing in the same sentence. The other three answers (intrinsic values and weighted-average grant-date fair value) were correctly identified and mapped to the option-instrument-specific tags. No numeric- or unit-conversion errors occurred; the mistake was a misassignment of which time interval the prompt's target \\\"years\\\" referred to.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model mapped the token \\\"years\\\" to the vesting-period concept rather than to the expiration/term concept. In other words, it chose the vesting-period tag instead of the expiration-period tag even though the sentence explicitly states a \\\"term of ten years.\\\"\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The error stemmed from ambiguous co-reference resolution: multiple temporal expressions were present and the model used a proximity heuristic (closest temporal phrase) rather than semantic cueing of the noun phrase modifying the number. It failed to disambiguate which \\\"years\\\" instance the question intended. The model's heuristic prioritized any 'vest/vest over' lexical match over detecting the stronger cue 'term of' -> expiration.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Disambiguate multiple temporal mentions by (1) identifying the numeric mention that the question targets (check surrounding nouns like \\\"term\\\", \\\"vest\\\", \\\"expiration\\\"), and (2) mapping the lexical cue to the correct taxonomy element: use vesting-period tag when the numeric phrase modifies \\\"vest\\\" or \\\"vesting\\\"; use expiration/term tag when the numeric phrase modifies \\\"term\\\", \\\"expire\\\", or \\\"expiration\\\". Here, the phrase \\\"term of ten years\\\" should map to SharebasedCompensationArrangementBySharebasedPaymentAwardExpirationPeriod. Also verify exact tag strings from the tag list (matching capitalization/punctuation) before finalizing.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When a sentence contains multiple time-period phrases, resolve which one the asked entity refers to by linking the number to its governing noun (e.g., \\\"vest\\\" -> vesting period; \\\"term\\\" or \\\"expire\\\" -> expiration period). Prioritize semantic role (term vs. vest) over proximity. Always confirm tag text exactly matches the official tag list.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
