Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"28\" in sentence: \"Property , Plant and Equipment The components of total property , plant and equipment , net are as follows : Depreciation expense of $ 29 million and $ 28 million was recognized in the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 respectively . Note 10 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"38\" in sentence: \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 are as follows : Other Intangible Assets Information regarding our other intangible assets is as follows : Amortization expense related to finite - lived intangible assets was $ 38 million and $ 31 million for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"31\" in sentence: \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 are as follows : Other Intangible Assets Information regarding our other intangible assets is as follows : Amortization expense related to finite - lived intangible assets was $ 38 million and $ 31 million for the three months ended March 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"2.250\" in sentence: \"The total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 463 million and $ 446 million as of March 31 , 2018 and December 31 , 2017 , respectively . Foreign Currency Denominated Debt On March 11 , 2016 , we issued 2.250 % Senior Notes of € 500 million aggregate principal amount due March 2023 .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I read each sentence and applied lexical mapping rules: 1) Q1: The sentence explicitly states \\\"Depreciation expense of $29 million and $28 million was recognized...\\\" — lexical cue 'Depreciation expense' deterministically maps to the Depreciation tag. No other context overrides this. 2) Q2: The sentence states \\\"Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $38 million...\\\" — lexical cue 'Amortization expense' tied to finite-lived intangible assets maps to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 3) Q3: The same sentence refers to the comparative amount for the prior period ($31 million) and uses the identical lexical cue \\\"Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets\\\" — map that amount the same way to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. 4) Q4: The phrase \\\"we issued 2.250 % Senior Notes of €500 million aggregate principal amount due March 2023\\\" contains a percentage explicitly tied to a named debt instrument ('Senior Notes'). Per the interest-rate heuristic, a percent adjacent to a named debt instrument maps to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. I therefore select: Depreciation, AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets, AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets, DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00011\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"Depreciation,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nDepreciation,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nDepreciation,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets,DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each sentence for lexical cues linking numeric amounts to accounting concepts. Q1: the phrase \\\"Depreciation expense of $29 million and $28 million was recognized\\\" directly signals the Depreciation tag (the list includes \\\"Depreciation\\\"). Q2: \\\"Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $38 million...\\\" clearly maps to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. Q3: the comparative amount ($31 million) is the same concept in the same sentence, so it uses the same tag AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets. Q4: \\\"we issued 2.250% Senior Notes...\\\" places a stated percentage directly on a debt instrument; this maps to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. I compared these choices to the ground truth and the predicted answer — they match exactly.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error occurred: the model correctly mapped each lexical cue to the appropriate US GAAP tag and the predicted answer matches the ground truth.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable since the reasoning and tag selection were correct. The model applied the correct heuristics (lexical mapping to explicit expense and interest-rate phrases).\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using direct lexical mapping: map explicit expense phrases like \\\"Depreciation expense\\\" to Depreciation, \\\"Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets\\\" to AmortizationOfIntangibleAssets, and a percent directly describing a named debt instrument to DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage. Ensure the chosen tag exactly matches the available tag names in the list.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Use proximate lexical cues (expense label, asset type, instrument name) and the syntactic relationship between a numeric value and the nearest accounting noun to select tags.
