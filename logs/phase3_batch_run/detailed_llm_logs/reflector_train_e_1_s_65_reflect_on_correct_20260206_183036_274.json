Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"1.9\" in sentence: \"As of September 30 , 2018 and December 31 , 2017 , we had approximately $ 2.1 million and $ 2.1 million , respectively , of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . Income tax expense was $ 2.4 million and $ 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"800,000\" in sentence: \"In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided , our ultimate exposure with respect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated condensed balance sheets or statements of cash flows , although they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated condensed statements of operations for a particular reporting period . Note 8 - Stockholders ’ Equity Stock Issuance - In February 2017 , we issued 800,000 shares ( on a post - split basis or 12,000,000 shares on pre - split basis ) of common stock , par value $ 0.16 2/3 per share , at the public offering price of $ 2.10 per share , and 500,000 shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock , par value $ 1.00 per share , with a liquidation preference of $ 100 per share , for total net proceeds of $ 72.3 million , after underwriting discount and offering expenses .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"500,000\" in sentence: \"In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided , our ultimate exposure with respect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated condensed balance sheets or statements of cash flows , although they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated condensed statements of operations for a particular reporting period .

What is best tag for entity \"7.25\" in sentence: \"Except in limited circumstances , at any time prior to March 31 , 2020 , a holder may convert Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at the minimum conversion rate of 2.7605 shares ( on a post - split basis ) of common stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock , subject to anti - dilution adjustments .

Per lexical-first precedence for expense labels (err-00002), map to the income tax expense tag: IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit.\\n2) \\\"800,000\\\" appears in a primary offering sentence: \\\"we issued 800,000 shares ... at the public offering price...\\\" Offering/issuance cues (\\\"issued\\\", \\\"public offering price\\\") trigger issuance mapping per the issuance delta flow (ph-00006) and equity rules (ctx-00001). Map to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues.\\n3) \\\"500,000\\\" likewise is shares \\\"we issued ... 500,000 shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock ...\\\" — issuance + offering cues -> map to StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues (same issuance tag applies to preferred issuance in this taxonomy context) per ph-00006 and ctx-00001.\\n4) \\\"7.25\\\" is the annual dividend rate \\\"at an annual rate of 7.25 percent of the liquidation preference...\\\" — a percentage that is a preferred-stock dividend rate maps to PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage (direct lexical cue 'dividends' + 'annual rate' for preferred stock). Final tag selections are: IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit, StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues, StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues, PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"err-00002\",\n    \"ph-00006\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00011\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues,PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I reviewed each numeric entity in its sentence and matched contextual lexical cues to the available US GAAP tags. For 1) the phrase explicitly states \\\"Income tax expense was $2.4 million and $1.9 million,\\\" so the canonical line-item label \\\"Income tax expense\\\" maps directly to IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit. For 2) and 3) the sentences contain issuance language (\\\"we issued 800,000 shares...\\\" and \\\"we issued... 500,000 shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock\\\"), so the correct mapping is the issuance tag StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues; the taxo list provided does not include a separate preferred-stock-issuance tag, so the general issuance tag is appropriate for both common and preferred share issuances. For 4) the phrase \\\"annual rate of 7.25 percent of the liquidation preference\\\" is a dividend rate on preferred stock and directly maps to PreferredStockDividendRatePercentage. I verified units (shares vs dollars vs percent) and instrument cues (common vs preferred) to select the most precise tag available in the provided list.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's mappings correctly matched each numeric entity to the most appropriate tag from the provided taxonomy.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable because the prediction matched the ground truth. The model correctly applied lexical-first matching, instrument recognition, and unit/type interpretation.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using a lexical-first strategy: identify the canonical line-item or instrument from nearby words (e.g., 'income tax expense', 'issued', 'dividends', 'percent'), confirm the numeric unit (dollars, shares, percent), and then pick the best-matching tag from the available taxonomy. If a more specific tag does not exist (e.g., preferred-share issuance), use the suitable general tag from the list (e.g., StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesNewIssues).\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map by lexical cues + unit: expense labels -> expense tags; 'issued' + shares -> issuance tag; 'percent' with 'dividend' and 'preferred' -> preferred dividend rate tag. Always confirm that the chosen tag actually exists in the provided taxonomy before finalizing.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
