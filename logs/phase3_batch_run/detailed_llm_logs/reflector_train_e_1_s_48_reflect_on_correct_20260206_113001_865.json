Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"0.0001\" in sentence: \"The consolidated financial statements as of December 31 , 2017 , including share and per share amounts , do not give effect to the IPO or conversion of the redeemable convertible preferred stock , as the IPO and such conversions were completed subsequent to December 31 , 2017 . Upon the completion of our IPO , our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock , $ 0.0001 par value per share , and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock , $ 0.0001 par value per share , all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated .?\"\n2.

Per the equity/plan lexical rules, 'par value per share' maps to a par/stated-value tag and 'authorized ... to issue up to N shares' maps to an authorized-shares tag. Step 2 — map each entity:\\n1) '0.0001 par value per share' is the par value for common stock in the clause 'authorized us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share' — apply par-value rule -> CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare.\\n2) '10,000,000' appears as '10,000,000 shares of preferred stock ... $0.0001 par value per share' and is an authorized amount of preferred shares per the charter language -> PreferredStockSharesAuthorized.\\n3) '100,000,000' appears as 'authorize us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock' -> CommonStockSharesAuthorized.\\n4) The later '0.0001 par value per share' again is a par value expression for common stock in the charter amendment sentence -> CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare.\\nStep 3 — sanity checks: ensured we selected the asset-specific equity tags rather than generic share or plan tags; selected preferred vs common authorized tags where the sentence specified the class. Final tag list (in question order): CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare, PreferredStockSharesAuthorized, CommonStockSharesAuthorized, CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00020\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nCommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nCommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare,PreferredStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockSharesAuthorized,CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I parsed each sentence for lexical anchors and corporate-charter context. \\\"par value per share\\\" unambiguously signals a par/stated-value equity tag. The phrases \\\"authorized us to issue up to X shares\\\" and \\\"shares of [class]\\\" indicate authorized share counts tied to a specific class. Applying those rules: the 0.0001 figures are par values -> CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare (common stock context). The 10,000,000 figure is an authorized count of preferred shares -> PreferredStockSharesAuthorized. The 100,000,000 figure is an authorized count of common shares -> CommonStockSharesAuthorized.
