Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"22.31\" in sentence: \"The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30 , 2018 , were 21.88 % and 23.73 % , respectively , compared to 22.31 % and 23.90 % for the same periods in 2017 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"142.5\" in sentence: \"7 Earnings per share At June 30 , 2018 , the number of shares outstanding was 142.5 million ( June 30 , 2017 - 146.1 million ) .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"146.1\" in sentence: \"7 Earnings per share At June 30 , 2018 , the number of shares outstanding was 142.5 million ( June 30 , 2017 - 146.1 million ) .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"0.1\" in sentence: \"11 The number of shares used in earnings per share calculations is reconciled as follows : For the three and six months ended June 30 , 2018 , there were 0.1 million and 0.2 million options , respectively , excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were not dilutive ( three and six months ended June 30 , 2017 - 0.3 million and 0.4 million ) .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Concise rationale (no internal chain-of-thought):\\n1) '22.31%' is an effective income tax rate for the period — maps to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations. 2) '142.5 million' is the number of shares outstanding at a date — maps to CommonStockSharesOutstanding. 3) '146.1 million' is the prior-period number of shares outstanding — maps to CommonStockSharesOutstanding. 4) '0.1 million' refers to options excluded from diluted EPS (antidilutive securities) — maps to AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount. These mappings follow the equity and tax lexical-to-tag rules for shares-outstanding, antidilutive items, and effective-tax-rate disclosures.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00003\",\n    \"ctx-00001\",\n    \"ctx-00007\",\n    \"ctx-SBC-00001\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,CommonStockSharesOutstanding,AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I validated each extracted entity against the sentence context and selected the tag that best matches the concept and units shown: \\n1) \\\"22.31%\\\" is explicitly an effective tax rate for a period, so EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations is the correct tag (percentage, tax rate disclosure). \\n2) \\\"142.5 million\\\" is the reported number of shares outstanding at a point in time, so CommonStockSharesOutstanding fits (share count outstanding). \\n3) \\\"146.1 million\\\" is the prior-period number of shares outstanding, which is the same concept as #2 and should use CommonStockSharesOutstanding. \\n4) \\\"0.1 million\\\" describes options excluded from diluted EPS because they were not dilutive — this maps to AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount (antidilutive securities count). \\nI compared the model's predicted tags to the ground truth and confirmed an exact match for all four items (environment feedback: match).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No error — the model's reasoning and tag assignments were correct and matched the ground truth for all four items.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no incorrect step. The model correctly interpreted context (rate vs. count vs. antidilutive exclusion) and selected the appropriate US GAAP tags.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using context-driven mapping: identify the semantic concept (tax rate, shares outstanding, antidilutive securities) and choose the canonical tag that represents that concept. Confirm units (percent vs. millions) and whether the figure is current- or prior-period — use the same tag when the concept is identical across periods.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Map by semantic concept rather than numeric format: percentages that represent tax rates → EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations; counts of shares outstanding → CommonStockSharesOutstanding; metrics of securities excluded from diluted EPS due to antidilution → AntidilutiveSecuritiesExcludedFromComputationOfEarningsPerShareAmount. Watch for nearby qualifiers (e.g., 'authorized', 'reserved', 'issued', 'outstanding') that change the tag.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
