Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"20.8\" in sentence: \"The income tax provision for the six months ended June 30 , 2018 was $ 51 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.8 % , compared to $ 35 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.1 % for the same period in 2017 .?\"\n2. What is best tag for entity \"35\" in sentence: \"The income tax provision for the six months ended June 30 , 2018 was $ 51 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.8 % , compared to $ 35 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.1 % for the same period in 2017 .?\"\n3. What is best tag for entity \"126\" in sentence: \"The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30 , 2018 was $ 126 million , as compared to $ 130 million at December 31 , 2017 , which if ultimately recognized will reduce our effective tax rate .?\"\n4. What is best tag for entity \"130\" in sentence: \"The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30 , 2018 was $ 126 million , as compared to $ 130 million at December 31 , 2017 , which if ultimately recognized will reduce our effective tax rate .?\"\nOutput US GAAP tags:\n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Concise rationale (no internal chain-of-thought): 1) The 20.8% figure is explicitly an effective income tax rate -> map to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations (matches tax-rate lexical cues and percent mapping rules). 2) The $35 amount is the income tax provision for the period (income tax provision = tax expense) -> map to IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit (taxonomy element for income tax expense/benefit). 3) The $126 amount is an unrecognized tax benefit and the sentence explicitly states that recognizing it would reduce the effective tax rate -> choose the more specific tag UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate. 4) The $130 amount (comparative balance at prior date) is the same concept as $126 and likewise maps to UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate.\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"ctx-00021\",\n    \"ctx-00003\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nEffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations,IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate,UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly mapped each entity to the appropriate US GAAP tag by using lexical and numeric cues in the sentences: 1) '20.8%' appears immediately after 'effective tax rate' → EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations. 2) '$35' is labeled 'income tax provision ... resulting in' → IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit (tax provision = tax expense/benefit). 3) '$126' is described as 'unrecognized tax benefits ... which if ultimately recognized will reduce our effective tax rate' → UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate. 4) '$130' is the comparative balance of the same unrecognized tax benefits at a prior date → also UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate. Each choice uses the most specific available taxonomy element that matches the linguistic cue and numeric type (percent vs dollar amount vs accounting balance).\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No errors: the predicted tags match the ground truth exactly. The reasoning trace correctly identified the lexical cues and selected the most specific, appropriate tags.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Not applicable — there was no incorrect decision. If there were to be a potential pitfall, it would be confusing 'income tax provision' with an effective tax rate (mixing a dollar amount with a percentage) or choosing a generic 'UnrecognizedTaxBenefits' tag when a more targeted '...ThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate' is available.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Continue using cue-based mapping: (a) map percentages tied to wording like 'effective tax rate' to EffectiveIncomeTaxRateContinuingOperations; (b) map dollar amounts described as 'income tax provision' or 'provision for income taxes' to IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit; (c) map balances described as 'unrecognized tax benefits' (especially when text notes an effect on the effective tax rate) to UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsThatWouldImpactEffectiveTaxRate. Prefer the most specific taxonomy element that captures both the concept and the metric type.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Match lexical cues and numeric types to taxonomy concepts: percent values with 'rate' → tax-rate tags; dollar provisions/expenses → tax-expense tags; labeled balance-sheet items like 'unrecognized tax benefits' → specific unrecognized-benefits tags (choose the variant mentioning impact on effective tax rate when the text explicitly links recognition to the rate).\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\n}",
