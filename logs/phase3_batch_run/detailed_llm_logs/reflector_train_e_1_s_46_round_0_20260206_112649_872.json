Answer the following 4 independent questions by providing only  4 US GAAP tags answers in the order of the questions. Each answer must be saperated by a comma (,).  Provide nothing else. \n1. What is best tag for entity \"5\" in sentence: \"• On December 30 , 2016 , the Company issued 150,000 shares to the Executive Chairman with a 5 - year vesting period , resulting in compensation expense of $ 0.9 million per year .?\"\n2.

Applied playbook heuristics: temporal/vesting mapping (ctx-00010), share-based-compensation semantic-modifier and plan rules (ctx-SBC-00001, ctx-00007), allocated expense selection for share-based compensation (ctx-00002), and reserved-vs-plan-authorized disambiguation / ESPP/plan-reserved handling (ctx-00009 / ctx-00001).\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"ctx-00010\", \"ctx-SBC-00001\", \"ctx-00002\", \"ctx-00009\", \"ctx-00001\"],\n  \"final_answer\": \"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense,DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized,CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance\"\n}\n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense,DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized,CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\nShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1,AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense,DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized,ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer does not match ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur?

  "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I compared the model's four predicted tags to the ground truth. The first three predicted tags match the ground truth: vesting period -> ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardAwardVestingPeriod1; compensation expense per year -> AllocatedShareBasedCompensationExpense; employer matching contributions -> DefinedContributionPlanCostRecognized. The only mismatch is the fourth tag. The sentence: \\\"The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of common stock to stockholders under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\\\" refers to an authorization of shares under a specific plan (a dividend reinvestment plan). The ground truth maps this to ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized (a tag for the number of shares authorized under a share-based arrangement). The model instead chose CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance, which is a broader tag for common stock shares reserved for future issuance and not specifically for shares authorized under a share-based plan. Thus the model applied a generic 'reserved shares' mapping rather than the plan-specific 'number of shares authorized' mapping.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"The model selected a broad 'shares reserved for future issuance' tag instead of the specific 'number of shares authorized under a share-based arrangement' tag for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. In short, it failed to recognize that the authorization belongs to a specific share-based plan and should use the plan-specific 'NumberOfSharesAuthorized' tag.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The conceptual error was misclassifying a plan-specific authorization as a generic equity reservation. The model likely relied on a heuristic that mapped language like 'authorized to issue X shares' to a general 'reserved for future issuance' tag, without checking for the presence of a named plan (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) that should trigger a share-based-compensation-specific tag. In other words, the nuance between 'shares reserved generally' and 'shares authorized under a particular share-based arrangement or plan' was misunderstood or overlooked.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"When the text states that shares are authorized to be issued 'under' a named plan (e.g., Dividend Reinvestment Plan, employee stock purchase plan, option plan), map to the plan-specific share-based-compensation tag for number of shares authorized: ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAuthorized. Reserve the more generic CommonStockCapitalSharesReservedForFutureIssuance tag for disclosures that describe general reservations of shares not tied to a particular share-based arrangement or plan.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"Keyword-driven disambiguation: if the phrase contains 'under the <PlanName>' or names a specific plan, prefer a share-based-compensation 'NumberOfSharesAuthorized' tag. Use the generic 'reserved for future issuance' tag only when no plan-specific context exists.\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00010\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-SBC-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00002\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00009\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"ctx-00001\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}",
